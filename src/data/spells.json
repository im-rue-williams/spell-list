		"description": "This spell enables the wizard to cause nonmagical fires - from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as the area of effect - to reduce in size and brightness to become mere coals or increase in light to become as bright as full daylight and increase the illumination to double the normal radius. Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire. The caster can affect any or all fires in the spell's area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elementals or similar creatures."

The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word. The material components of this spell are a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire."

		"description": "To cast this spell, the transmuter must wash themselves in soap and water, creating a plethora of bubbles which they then cover themselves with. The washing process is magical. Any normal soap will be extra sudsy, helping to facilitate the process. When the wizard is done with washing, any area that retains bubbles is covered with a spell that increases one's perceived attractiveness. It should be noted that attractiveness is not the same as charisma, and this spell has no effect on one's charisma. For purposes of this spell, attractiveness is a non-standard stat based on a 3d6 roll, and this spell increases one's attractiveness to a minimum of 15, or by 1d4, whichever is higher. A character may not exceed 18 hotness. Allure persists until the caster speaks or makes any verbal sound. The spell similarly fails if the bubbles are washed off, or if the caster falls asleep.  Should this spell be dispelled, the change is instant. All people viewing the subject see the transformation instantly. It is made even more apparent by the fact the caster is probably still covered in bubbles. Someone making physical contact with an Allured section of the caster (i.e. an area covered by unseen magic bubbles) will feel the bubbles, breaking them, and breaking the spell. "

		"save": "None",
		"damage": "",
		"description": "This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the 'direction' in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies. For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good. A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance). Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of 'animal' or 'non-,' it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance). The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting."

		"description": "By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that he desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.). The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly. The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained. The material components of this spell are the caster's holy symbol and a piece of food liked by the animal."

The spell has no effect on giant-sized versions of these creatures unless they are less than 1 Hit Die. The barrier affects summoned creatures, such as those called by a summon insects spell. Any vermin within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected; however, when these creatures exit the area, they cannot return. The spell affects a cubic area whose sides are 10 feet times the caster's level (for instance, a 2nd-level priest could affect a 20'x 20'x 20' cube.

		"description": "By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (+4AC). The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 14 or better. It is not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is important to note that the armor does not absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 14; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained. The material component is a piece of finely cured leather that has been blessed by a priest."

		"description": "This spell enhances the casters movement capabilities in extraplanar settings by attuning him to his new surroundings. While very few 1st-level priests find themselves in this situation, higher level characters often make use of this spell. Astral celerity doubles the characters movement rate on the Astral Plane; normally, characters move at a rate of 30 times their Intelligence score in feet per round, but this spell increases this to 60 feet times their Intelligence score. As an incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to the plane much faster and suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral. While astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall scheme of the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but relative speed could be very important in avoiding an unpleasant encounter or escaping from pursuit of some kind."

		"description": "When the audible glamer spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster.  The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men. A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction.  Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell. The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax."

Clothing worn may be damaged or destroyed. If armor is worn while the spell is cast, it fuses with the bark and immobilizes the subject. This process takes the rest of the round in which the spell was cast to grow. While enchanted so, the subject reduces incoming damage by 3. The bark shapes at random making it impossible to wear armor over it. The spell may be dispelled with a touch and a word. When it is dispelled or when the duration is ended, the bark falls off the person in large chunks and remains on the ground. The bark is of the same kind the caster used in the spell."

		"description": "Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures and any saving throw rolls they make against fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, affects only those not already engaged in melee combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt for use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends. Multiple bless spells are not cumulative. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture components, the bless spell requires holy water. This spell can be reversed by the priest to a curse spell that, when cast upon enemy creatures, lowers their morale and attack rolls by -1. The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy water."

		"description": "By means of this spell, the priest can accurately estimate the chance of success of one specific action, such as climbing a dangerous cliff, making a trick bowshot, crossing a burning room unharmed, or even striking an enemy. The action in question must be one that would normally be resolved by a die roll, but the priest doesn't have to be the person who attempts the feat; he can use calculate to estimate the odds for anyone taking an action in his sight. The priest has a 70% chance, +2% per level, of making an accurate estimate. If successful, the DM reveals to the player the action's chance for success or any modifiers that may be in play. For example, he could reveal a particular opponent's Armor Class or THAC0, the saving throw an opponent would require in order to save against a particular spell cast by the priest or the priest's wizard companion, or a character's chance to open doors, bend bars, or use a thief ability. The priest could even calculate his odds for actions that might be resolved by a die roll or DM caprice, such as his chance to avoid detection by hiding behind a rock. This spell takes into account factors that the priest himself may not be aware of, so from time to time a character may receive some very confusing results from this spell. For instance, if the priest doesn't know that an orc chieftain is actually a polymorphed tanar'ri masquerading as an orc, he may be astonished to learn that the 'orc' has a THAC0 of 7! If the priest fails his calculation check with a roll of 99 or 00, his calculation is wildly skewed in a random fashion.

		"description": "Cantrips are minor spells I studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The cantrip spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell.  So minor are these effects that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives.  Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, these are the tools to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard."

The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster group in the same round the charm is cast an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw. If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an on rushing red dragon for 'just a round or two.' Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands). The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 3 or less: 3 months  Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 4 to 6: 2 months  Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 7 to 9: 1 month  Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 10 to 12: 3 weeks  Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 13 to 14: 2 weeks Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 15 to 16: 1 weeks Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 17: 3 days Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 18: 2 days Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 19 or more: 1 days Note: The period between checks is the time period during which the check occurs. When to roll the check during this time is determined (randomly or by selection) by the DM. The roll is made secretly."

After this occurs, the spell ends and the unit must make all future morale checks normally. If a unit under the influence of a courage spell is not forced to make any morale checks, the spell expires at the first sunset. When several different events simultaneously trigger morale checks, the BATTLESYSTEM rules apply penalties to a single morale check.

Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not. The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or detect good) spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must concentrate--stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a reading.

It is useful for recording conversations, verbal agreements, interrogations, or even notes or observations if the wizard doesn't want to take the time to write them down himself. Generally, a person reading aloud takes about one to five minutes to read a page, depending on how many words are on page. Foreign languages are not translated, although foreign words are given the correct alphabetic spelling in the wizard's native tongue; for example, the  phrase 'cest la vie' would appear as it does here, with no English translation, but a phrase or name in Arabic or Chinese would not be transcribed in those alphabets. Magical spells and invocations are not recorded, so this spell can't be used to create a backup copy of a scroll even as it's read by the wizard, but a clever wizard may be able to record a magical item's command word if an enemy within ranges uses it while the spell is in effect. he material component for this spell is the blank page, scroll, or paper that the dictation will appear on. This must be prepared with a special wash of vinegar, which brings the cost to 10 gold pieces per page so readied."

If no similar object is within range, the spell fizzles.  A wizard could hold a sword in one hand while casting this spell to summon the nearest other sword to them. Items must be of the same material (steel sword summons a steel sword) and general type (arming sword could summon a scimitar, but not a dagger). Objects to be summoned must be independent, thus trying to duplicate brick near a brick building would only succeed if there was a loose brick somewhere nearby. The only way to call a specific item is to have that item be the closest of its kind to you. If trying to summon a specific key, the caster would need to be positioned closer to that key than to any others, including keys they may have on their person. The spell will not cross planes or pull items from extra dimensional space, such as from within a bag of holding or a portable hole.

For example, it might tell the priest that the subject is fearful, but the spell cannot reveal what the subject is afraid of or why he is afraid. Emotion read does not reveal individual thoughts or the subject's motivation. Thus, the spell might reveal that the subject is coldly unemotional at the moment, but not the fact that the subject is contemplating the cold-blooded murder of the priest. Note that this reading is instantaneous. It reveals only the emotion that is strongest at the instant the spell is used.

The subject is allowed a normal saving throw vs. spells to resist this spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest receives no reading at all.

It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. Magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stein would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionally with size.  For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered. The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot increments to less than one foot, by one-inch increments to one inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness. For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. A rowboat that has a length of 14', a depth of 2', and a beam of 4' has a volume of 112 cubic feet. A rough volume measurement for a humanoid is: height cubed, divided by 24 (h³/24).

The caster's movement rate is tripled for the duration of the spell, so a wizard with a movement of 12 would be able to run at a rate of 36 while the spell was in effect. In addition, the wizard can jump up to 5 feet in the air or make a 15-foot horizontal leap with ease. The wizard does not have to move while the spell is in effect, but if he moves at all, his unnatural speed and bounds prevent him from taking any other actions except for running- in other words, he can't take a half-move and throw a missile, or charge, cast a spell, or do anything else except move. The wizard cannot increase his movement further by any means, including additional movement-affecting magical spells or items. Kerith was also noted for his cynical observation to a companion."

		"description": "This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come.  The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.). The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to one mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic - while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the 'big ones' it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes. If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizards saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed.  If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies. The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1.000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away. Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results. On a d20 roll of 1-5 a black Cat is summoned, granting excellent night vision & superior hearing On a d20 roll of 6-7 a Crow is summoned, granting excellent vision On a d20 roll of 8-9 a Hawk is summoned, granting very superior distance vision On a d20 roll of 10-11 a Owl is summoned, granting night vision equal to human daylight vision and superior hearing On a d20 roll of 12-13 a Toad is summoned, granting wide-angle vision On a d20 roll of 14-15 a Weasel is summoned, granting superior hearing & very superior olfactory power On a d20 roll of 16-20 no familiar is available within spell range The referee can substitute other small animals suitable to the area."

		"description": "A grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall.  Those who successfully save can reach the nearest non-greased surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured!  The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item - a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc.  Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item.  The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one round per level.  The material component of the spell is a bit of pork rind or butter."

The affected door will remain shut unless magically opened, physically battered down, or the spell expires. Any extra-planar creature (djinn, elemental, etc.) with 4 or more Hit Dice can shatter the spell and burst open the portal. A wizard of 4 or more experience levels higher than the spellcaster can open the held portal at will. A knock spell or a successful dispel magic spell can negate the hold portal. The caster may channel the spell for as long as they like, and the duration begins from the point at which they stop channeling. E.G. Adea and her companions are being chased by goblins down a hallway when she comes to a door. Running through and slamming it shut, she tries to cast Hold Portal to buy the party some time. Initiative is rolled and Adea comes out on top. She begins to channel the hold portal spell, giving the rest of her party time to come up with a plan. Several hours later a plan has been made, and she stops the channeling and steps away. The door will continue to be held for a number of rounds equal to her level if the goblins are still interested. As a ritual, this spell can be made permanent. The caster prepares a special ink made with fine iron powder and a dark fluid. One standard door [20 square feet] can be appropriately inked in one day, with one ounce, and one dexterity check by the spell caster. Larger doors require more of each, although one failed dexterity check and the entire door will need to be washed and started over again. Unless exceptionally large or unusual, a doorframe can then be inked in one day, with one ounce, and one dexterity check. The spell is then cast into the ink, door, and frame, binding them together permanently. The ink now stains the door, but with effort or time and exposure will fade. If enough ink is removed or faded, the spell breaks. Different fluids can provide different additional affects. Fine Wine: 1gp/oz. No special effect. Blood: Fresh caster's blood that drains 2hp / oz. The door emits an unearthly wail when something larger than a rat approaches it. The wail is in the voice of the caster, starts softly when something is within 30', and gets louder until it is a full screech just before the door is touched. Contact with the door ends the wail until nothing is within proximity again. Tar thinned with exceptionally high prof alcohol: 5gp/oz The door becomes sticky to the touch, requiring a strength check to be removed. 1 year fermented poultice [Wooden doors only]: The door grows brambles and spikes that snare clothes, and rip exposed flesh. Nightblossom Nectar: 100gp/oz. The door becomes semi-transparent, allowing those one one side to see details from those within 5' on the other side."

		"description": "Hornung, one of the leading wizards in the field of wild magic (before his untimely disappearance while experimenting with wildwind),developed this spell to improve the accuracy of his estimates. The spell provides a wizard with an instant and highly accurate-estimate of the number of persons or objects in a group. The spell's area effect is one group of a general class of objects. All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group's size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole is concealed from sight. The estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten .For example, if Hornung's guess were cast on a group of 439 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40. Clearly, using the spell on small groups(especially those with fewer than 10 members) is pointless. Hornung's guess can be used to quickly estimate the size of treasure hoards and army units. It is particularly popular with moneylenders and generals."

		"description": "When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceeding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw. The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveal nothing). Only one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5-th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell. The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charges ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged. After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character). The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multi-functional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned."

He cannot direct a magic missile to 'Strike the commander of the legion,' unless he can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers.  Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out.  Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect. Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile - he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple missile capability, he can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired. "

The new message is completely legible and is recognizable as the handwriting of the original author, but is contrary in content to the original message. After the spell is cast, the message will appear different every day. The DM decides the message that the page will carry after the sixth day has passed. Following is a sample of the changes that could take place in a message. Day One: The words of the letter appear faint, as if the author of the letter was running out of ink as he wrote. Day Two: The words have moved slightly from their original positions, as if the person writing the letter were shaking or in a moving carriage when the letter was written. Days Three and Four: The message is gibberish. Although the ink forms groups of letters arranged in lines with punctuation, nearly all the words are meaningless. This may appear to be some sort of code, but it means nothing. Day Five: The ink has formed real words. However, the sentence construction is still meaningless (e.g., Egg west worse green!). Day Six (and beyond): The message is coherent, but the opposite intent of the original message has been created. If the original letter read, 'Send troops quickly,' the new letter reads, 'All is fine. Keep your men in reserve.' If mistaken missive is cast on the pages of a spellbook or a scroll, the ink on the page reforms into a new spell of the same level as the original spell. Thus, a darkness spell might become a maze spell. However, the spell formula will be wrong. Although it will look like a proper spell, it will not function when cast. A coded message that is subjected to mistaken missive will appear as a coded message on the sixth day but will hold a different meaning than the original message. A glass of preserved words will allow the original message to be read correctly. Dispel magic will restore the message to its original form. The material component is three drops of ink."

The mage must be able to cast the spell (i.e., have it in his spell books), but need not have it memorized. After announcing the spell (along with the target and any other conditions required by the spell), the wild mage casts Nahal's reckless dweomer. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is rolled randomly on Table 2: Wild Surge Results. Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected.

After casting the spell, the mage studies seemingly random elements-broken bits of glass, shreds of paper, intermingled trails, etc. The items to be studied must be tangible-coded flashing lights, garbled speech, or thoughts of any kind cannot be studied. The wizard must study the random elements for one round, after which the DM secretly makes a saving throw vs. spell for the wizard. If the saving throw is failed, the spell fails. However, if the saving throw is successful, the caster sees in his mind the pattern these objects form. If the items studied are truly random, no information is gained. After the caster has visualized the pattern, he can attempt to reassemble the parts into their original form. This requires another saving throw vs. spell to determine whether the mage remembers sufficient details to accomplish the task. The amount of time required and the quality of restoration vary according to the complexity of the pattern. Reassembling a shredded map may be easy; reassembling a broken clock is significantly more difficult; rebuilding a shattered mosaic is extremely difficult. In any case, the wizard can make only a reasonable copy of the item. He can use this spell to restore works of art, but they will be worth only a small percentage of their original value.

The victim is allowed a saving throw to negate the spell's effects. If you are using the fatigue rules from the Player's option; Combat &tactics book, this spell operates in a slightly different manner-fresh characters become fatigued, gaining one level of encumbrance; fatigued characters become exhausted, gaining two levels of encumbrance; and exhausted characters collapse in a quivering heap, unable to move or attack."

The priests may not move from their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or material component while the ring is formed. The ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons. The barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every priest in the circle. Attempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier. Because the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. Furthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow. Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the priests intervene. The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell."

		"description": "One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a 'freestanding mental object.' This 'thought object' usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory. This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest. Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle. The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle. The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale."

The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic. For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.

For example, if a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful, the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome: 'weal,' 'woe,' or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for each level of the priest casting the spell; for example, 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury. For example, if the question is 'Will we do well if we venture to the third level?' and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight), the augury might be: 'Great risk brings great reward.' If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might be: 'Woe and destruction await!' Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the same action in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice rolls. The material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting)."

The object will radiate magic at a specific 'frequency', for lack of a better metaphor. It is similar in nature to flying a flag that is only visible through magic. This frequency can be locked onto with spells that attempt to locate a specific place. The caster of Beacon knows the specific resonance, but other mages must discover it to use it. There are many interactions, some of which are listed below. Identify: The Beacon resonance is treated as a normal property to be discovered. Once discovered this way, it is known forever. Detect Magic: When cast on an item with a Beacon spell, the signature resonance of the beacon can be learned for the duration of Detect Magic and picked up on at a range of 1 mile per level. For example, an adventuring party comes across some loot. The wizard of the party detects magic and sees that the ring in the pile is not only magical, but it has a beacon on it! Before they can pick it up, the rogue takes the ring and runs away. Fur the duration of Detect Magic, the wizard will be able to pick up on that beacon (provided they are looking in the right direction of course), at a range of up to 1 mile per level. Once the Detect Magic spell wears off, the beacon's signature is lost. Locate Object: If the signature of a beacon is known, Locate Object will pick up on the beacon at a range of 1 mile per level. For example, Ginger the Enchanter has created a beacon on a necklace she's given to her younger sister. Ginger then uses a locate object spell to find the beacon and thus her sister, or uses a messenger spell with the beacon as a destination.  Locate Beacon: Used to permanently learn the signature of a beacon. Unlike Identify, there is no chance of failure. Further uses of Locate Beacon can be found in the description of that spell."

		"description": "This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people. The situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom brawl) to joy and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival). Unlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of affected creatures--anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the spell remains in effect. Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster are affected first. After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters for hours or days. Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends or the spell expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd is freed of the spell. In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention would be diverted and the individuals could act freely. Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that ends the spell."

		"description": "Following the discovery of wild magic came the discovery of wild surges and the personal danger such surges create. After several wild mages destroyed themselves by rather spectacular means (or suffered very odd side effects), the chaos shield was created as protection from these surges. This spell imbues the wild mage with special protection against the effects of wild surges. It protects only against wild surges caused by the caster's own spells, not from the effects of another mage's surges. When a wild surges affects a caster protected by chaos shield, he is allowed a saving throw vs. magic. If the saving throw is successful, the effect of the surge on the caster is negated. If the saving throw is failed, the caster is affected normally by the surge. The spell does not protect against wild surges that might be caused by its own casting. The chaos shield protects of a wild surge for other characters who might be in the area of effect. The caster cannot voluntarily cancel the protection once he has learned the nature of a wild surge; the chaos shield protects from both good and harmful effects. Thus, if a wild surge resulted  in a heal spell for all characters within 10 feet of the caster, the protected caster might not benefit, while all others in the radius would be healed. The spell remains in effect until it negates a wild surge or the spell duration expires."

		"description": "This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for 'just a minute or two' and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival. The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as, 'Ask him this question. . .,' nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of character. Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell. This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship. Intelligence Score Period Between Checks 3 or less 3 months 4-6 2 months 7-9 1 month 10-12 3 weeks 13-14 2 weeks 15-16 1 week 17 3 days 18 2 days 19 or more 1 day If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically. If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated. This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period."

Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In the third case, the spell affects the space about one foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell.  Note that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class by 4.  If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials can last hundreds or even thousands of years."

The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the caster can instead chose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 cubic foot volume each).  If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space.

The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a 3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet-the ethereal barrier only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while this spell can't be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates, or the passage of astral creatures. Ethereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four 6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a total of 9 turns. This spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of Magic). The material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square to be warded."

		"description": "When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps--concealed normally or magically--of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional, and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices. The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise inactive."

The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it.  A knock spell cannot affect a fire trap in any way - as soon as the offending party opens the item, the trap discharges. As with most magical traps, a thief has only half his normal find traps score to detect a fire trap. Failure to remove it succesfully detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell will not detonate the spell.  When the trap is discharged, there will be an explosion of five-foot radius from the spell's center. All creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster; half that total amount for creatures successfully saving. (Underwater, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast (the method usually involves a keyword). To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a stick of charcoal and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another individual requires a hair or similar object from the individual. The material components are holly berries."

It can be extinguished by the same means as any normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame.

As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond two feet. As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, measuring 40 feet x 20 feet x 20 feet. This moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes and den openings. Very thick vegetation breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet into the vegetation. The only effect of either version is to obscure vision.  A strong breeze will disperse either effect in one round, while a moderate breeze will reduce the spell duration by 50%.

Any creature viewing the 'gold' is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, which can be modified by the creature's Wisdom; for every level of the wizard, the creature must subtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is unlikely that fools' gold will be detected if it was created by a high-level caster.  If the 'gold' is struck hard by an object of cold-wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will revert to its natural state, depending on the material component used to create the - 'gold.' If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and sprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, the chance that cold iron will return it to its true nature is 30%;  if a 50-gp amber stone is powdered and used, there is a 25% chance that iron will dispel the magic;  if a 250-gp topaz is powdered, the chance drops to 10%; if a 500-gp oriental (corundum) topaz is powdered, there is only a 1% chance that the cold iron will reveal that it is fools' gold."

When any creature other than the caster comes within three feet of the enchanted object, it instantly sprouts appendages and moves away from the creature as quickly as possible. The enchanted object continues to move until it is at least 10 feet away from the nearest creatures in the area. After the enchanted object has moved a satisfactory distance from the nearest creature, the appendages disappear. When a creature again comes within three feet of the enchanted object, the enchanted object sprouts appendages and flees. This process continues until the enchantment is negated (through a dispel magic or similar spell) or the enchanted object is subdued or destroyed. The enchanted object can sprout feet (MV 24), wings (Fl 24, maneuverability class B), or fins (Sw 24), whichever is most advantageous. Thus, a book on a shelf might sprout wings and fly away, while a table might gallop around a room. The enchanted object can freely and instantly trade appendages as necessary. The enchanted object will move only through open spaces. It will not crash through windows, shatter a closed door, or dig through the earth. It cannot attack or take any actions other than movement. If surrounded or cornered, the enchanted object moves in random directions until it is restrained or destroyed. The enchantment ends if the caster voluntarily negates it, if the enchanted object is destroyed (the object has the same vulnerabilities as it has in its normal state), or if the enchanted object is restrained for 2-5 (1d4+1) consecutive rounds. Restraint means that the object is prevented from fleeing; if a creature is able to grapple, lift, or sit on the object, it is considered restrained. A creature capable of lifting the object in its normal state is considered strong enough to restrain it (for instance, a person capable of lifting a 50-pound box is also capable of restraining such a box enchanted by frisky chest). The object may also be restrained by tossing a net or heavy blanket over it or by surrounding it with several characters. The material components are a dried frog's leg, a feather, and a fish scale."

Elven chain mail is not affected, and magical metal armor receives an item saving throw vs. magical fire to avoid being heated. The material component is a holy symbol. On the first round of the spell, the metal merely becomes very warm and uncomfortable to touch (this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration). During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds, heat causes blisters and damage; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal becomes searing hot, causing damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: Metal Temperature Damage per Round very warm none hot 1d4 points searing* 2d4 points * On the final round of searing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot--becomes unusable for 2d4 days; body--becomes disabled for 1d4 days; head--fall unconscious for 1d4 turns. This effect can be completely removed by the 6th-level priest spell heal spell or by normal rest. Note also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell, as does immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function under water. For every two experience levels of the caster, the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds of weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 5th-level caster two, etc. The reverse of the spell, chill metal, counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows: Metal Temperature Damage per Round cold none icy 1-2 points freezing* 1d4 points * On the final round of freezing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp. The chill metal spell is countered by a resist cold spell, or by any great heat--proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of fire spell, etc. Under water, this version of the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, exerting an upward buoyancy."

He is effectively immune to exposure, dehydration, and heat or cold injury, since no naturally occurring climatic condition will cause him harm. (Lightning, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other such hazardous phenomena can still cause physical injury, of course.) During the iron vigil, the priest is able to ignore the need to sleep by choosing to meditate instead. While meditating, the priest can keep watch on his surroundings, but he suffers a +1 penalty to any surprise checks. If the character wishes to memorize spells, he must sleep normally. At the vigil's end, the priest must eat and drink; if no food or water is available, the character must make a Constitution check once every four hours at a cumulative -1 penalty or fall into a coma and perish within 1d3 days if he receives no aid. He also requires at least four hours of rest for each day that he did not eat, drink, or sleep during his vigil."

Creatures with very thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basically unaffected. There are two versions of the spell, either of which can be cast from the standard preparation: Itching. When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching sensation on some portion of its body. If one round is not immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature is so affected that the next three rounds are spent squirming and twisting, effectively worsening its Armor Class by 4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. Spell preparations are ruined in the first round this spell is in effect, but not in the following three rounds. Doing nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, the saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at two creatures, the saving throw has a -1 penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, the saving throw is normal. Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin breaks out in red welts that itch. The rash persists until either a cure disease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish immediately upon the removal of the rash, and all statistics return to normal. This can be cast at one creature only, with a saving throw penalty of -2. The material component for this spell is a leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac."

In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds - although the former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.  Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door).  Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known - the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door. The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis."

If the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can move vertically up or down at a movement rate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or another creature, the wizard can levitate it at the same speed according to his command.  Horizontal movement is not empowered by this spell, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, for example, to move laterally.  The spellcaster can cancel the spell as desired. If the subject of the spell is unwilling, or the object is in the possession of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is allowed to determine if the levitate spell affects it. Once cast, the spell requires no concentration, except when changing height. A levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, and the third -3, etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow.

		"description": "Casting this spell draws on the knowledge of all creatures within the range, and poses a subconscious question to these creatures: Where is the landmark in question. The answer is then returned to the caster as long as the location is on the current plane of existence, and there is a general consensus from the creatures in the area. Landmarks must be stationary and singular. Should a stationary landmark be moved, perhaps the 'Great Tree of Vitality' has been cut down and moved, the original location of the landmark as it is known to people in the range of the spell is used. Mobile landmarks, like a King's Crown, automatically fail. In preparation for this spell, an 10' diameter area must be prepared. If an area has already been prepared (such as a dedicated divination room within a wizard's lair), the spell can be cast straight away taking only 4 hours. If such an area must be constructed, the area must be made uniform and neat. A wheel must be carefully inscribed on the outside with radial spikes to the center. This can be etched, painted, or even made with sticks in a pinch, but the preparation and placement must be exact. In optimal conditions, this takes 2 hours (e.g. paint on an empty warehouse floor). In ordinary conditions, this takes 4 hours (e.g. etching on flat stone). In poor conditions, this takes 6 hours (e.g. sticks and leaves in the forest floor). If the caster is in a hurry, they may use half the prep time with a successful intelligence check. If the check is failed, the caster has not prepared the area correctly and the spell flubs. Generally it is best to roll the intelligence as the spell is being cast. The actual casting of the spell takes 4 hours, during which time the caster must sit still in the center of the wheel with their eyes closed and their mind in an open state. They cannot carry conversation or interact with objects without flubbing the spell. The magic sweeps the area in an apparently haphazard manner before returning to the caster a direction (if the spell is successful).  Example: Bobo the diviner casts Locate Landmark, with the landmark in question being the secret burial ground of elves. Bobo is in a human dominated region, where nobody knows the answer to this question, so it returns no answer. Bobo then decides to head to a major port where there are many elves, and casts the spell again. The compass in his hand turns to point North West. Bobo doesn't know how far North West it is, so he travels North West for six days before casting the spell again. This time he is in a small elvan port town that allows human visitors. He casts the spell again, and gets a direction of south west. Bobo knows he's overshot the distance, and can change directions, heading south this time. A very careful wizard with a compass and map might be able to triangulate the location of a landmark, although this can be tricky since the further the target is from the landmark, the more the compass needle wobbles.

The size of the circle dictates how much chalk, silver, and lead is needed, as well as the casting time. Each foot of diameter consumes 30cp worth of lead or 60cp worth of silver and takes 2 minutes to create. Once the circle is created, the spell takes 1 minute to cast. Once the circle is drawn and the spell is cast, nothing (physical or magical) may cross the boundary within the circle. If the chalk and powder circle is broken (a hair or straw laying across it, or being scuffed, for example), the spell is instantly broken. Items or creatures may be summoned within the circle, preventing them from running free, but also preventing the caster, or others, from interacting with the creature. While touch and spells may not cross the border, non-magical sounds may. A creature inside the circle may attempt to break out. To do so, the creature rolls a d10 and adds their willpower and their number of hit dice. The spellcaster rolls the same thing. If the creature's roll equals or beats the caster's, the creature breaks free of the circle. If the circle is made with silver, instead of lead, the caster has advantage on the d10 roll. When this spell is broken in this way, there is a short but blinding flash of light outside the circle. An attempt to break free can be made once a turn. This circle may be reused over and over, as long as it is not disturbed. A permanent magic circle can be made at 100x the cost. The permanent version of this circle uses inlaid stones and molten metals. The spell, but not the physical circle, may be dispelled by the original caster with a touch."

While locks on homes and chests tend to be of similar size, desk locks tend to have smaller keys, and gates tend to have larger keys. Too much material in the spell component is usually possible to work around, perhaps producing a key with a large handle, but having too small of a spell component can lead to unusable results for large keyed locks.

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated - if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms.  The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster.  Some examples are to speak 'to the first creature that touches you,' or 'to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.' Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: 'Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.' Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards ('Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.').  The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.

If mind read is used as part of an interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives a saving throw at a -2 penalty.

		"description": "After anointing a nonliving object with burning sage, speaking the words, and going through the movements, the spell caster creates a rectangular scrap of paper with magic runes on it that affixes itself to a nonliving object of the caster's choice. If ever a living creature nears the ward, the runes emit a soft orange glow. The scrap of paper cannot be removed without being destroyed, and if the scrap is destroyed it explodes, dealing 2d4 (+1 point per level) damage to everything in a 10' radius, potentially destroying the item it was warding. Saving throws for half. Usually the seal is placed over a door and frame so that the door cannot be opened without ripping the paper. Those with walls or other structures between them may make a saving throw for no damage, suffering half damage on a fail. Example 1: A minor sealing ward is placed over on a door frame, with creatures on either side. One creature opens the door, setting off the ward. Those on the ward side of the door save for half damage, taking full on a fail, while those on the opposite side save for no damage, taking half on a fail. Example 2: A wizard wishes to dissuade guests from entering a room in his house. He places a Minor Sealing Ward on across the door and frame near the handle for all to see. Should someone open the door, or fail to remove the ward (find/remove traps), they will save for half, or take the full damage. The ward itself is made of a tough and durable material, requiring a small effort to tear. It is unlikely for the ward to be destroyed through accident or exposure to the elements.  The ward may be dispelled by the caster at will, or removed by any other spell caster 3 levels higher than the original caster."

When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck.  The images seem to shift from round to round, so that if the actual wizard is struck during one round, he cannot be picked out from among his images the next.  To determine the number of images that appear, roll 1d4 and add 1 for every three levels of experience the wizard has achieved, to a maximum of eight images.

		"description": "Theoretically, every action has a particular moment at which it will have its greatest possible effect. Using the arcane mathematics of this spell, the priest can determine the 'ideal moment' for any single action in each round that the spell is in effect. This action must be performed by a character other than the priest. In practice, another character informs the priest of an action he wants to undertake in a round. The priest concentrates on the action, then informs the character when the 'correct moment' has come. The character then gains a bonus of 20% (+4 on a d20) to the success of his action. The spell can affect only a single action in a given round. When used in combat, the priest can advise the best moment to initiate an action (affecting initiative) or what moment offers the greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to hit). If the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit. Characters who seek the best attack frequently delay their actions. These characters suffer a +1 on their initiative roll but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused, since the act (striking) has already succeeded at that point. Characters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than gaining +4 to hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified initiative. The character gains no bonus from the moment spell, and the priest can affect no other action in that round. Noncombat actions can also benefit from the moment spell. For example, a thief planning to climb a wall may wait to start her climb until the priest informs her that the moment is right. If she waits, she gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the bonus is subtracted from her roll). While concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action. A break in the priest's concentration--taking damage in combat, for example--terminates the spell instantly. The material component is a set of three silver dice, which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The dice are not consumed in the casting."

The listener receives a normal saving throw against this effect. Failure means that the listener is entranced and is unable to attack the priest for the duration of the spell. In addition, the music makes the subject gullible and more susceptible to charm magics such as charm person, suggestion, and hypnotism. While the music spell is in effect, the subject saves against charm spells with a -3 penalty. This spell does not protect other characters in company with the priest; listeners who have fallen prey to the music are free to attack anyone else. The spell effect ends instantly if the priest takes any hostile action against a creature under the influence of the spell. Music of the spheres can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject at 3rd level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle. Potential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to understand the concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot be deaf and there can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means that the level of background noise must be low enough for the music to be audible. The DM should assume that the music is the same volume as an average human's normal speaking voice. If the potential subject could not hear speech at the appropriate range under prevailing conditions, the spell cannot affect that subject. The spell would be virtually useless in the midst of a full-scale battle or during a hurricane. The material component comprises a set of three small bows made from fine silver, each costing 100 gp.

On one round, a priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn. Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos. Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect. For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a 10th-level priest 'passes' a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another priest who has an active mystic transfer. The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest. The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant action. A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air."

		"description": "When this spell is placed upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat or cold, as chosen by the caster. The spell grants the creature complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note). The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus of +3 to saving throws against such attack forms and all damage sustained is reduced by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is failed, the creature sustains one-half damage, and if the saving throw is successful, the creature sustains only one-quarter damage. Resistance to fire lasts for one round for each experience level of the priest placing the spell. The caster needs a drop of mercury as the material component of this spell."

		"description": "When the great wizard Ferris built a hidden fortress for himself and his apprentices, he lined many segments of the base with Waltraud's Wonderous Walls to allow observation of the outside, difficult ingress, easy egress, and to provide light. After some time, Ferris found it frustrating that his friends were forbidden from his fortress, and thus he created the Reveal Wonderous Walls spell. Handed down to his apprentices, this spell allows a section of Wonderous Walls to be revealed and disabled for 1 round, letting the caster enter at will. Technically, this spell creates a tiny portal, big enough for only the tip of a finger to pass through, that exits exactly 1 inch behind the spot touched, allowing the caster to activate the wall from behind. Thus when casting this spell, only one very small point may be touched - a caster could not press both hands 5 feet apart with this spell in hopes that either hand may find a wonderous wall segment, but they could touch a single segment with a finger, toe, or tip of nose to deactivate the wall. The portal created by this spell is only active for a brief moment, activated by touch, and does not typically have any use outside deactivating Wonderous Walls, although under the right set of circumstances may allow someone to press a button on the reverse side of a wall. (The circumstances for this are so narrow that such a button would have to be carefully crafted and placed with the intent for it to be activated by use of this spell). "

The spellcaster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them. The rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option).

		"description": "This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere within a specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group of priests. After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area. Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs. fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified ground. Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified ground turns undead as if he were one level higher. Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used, with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6thlevel priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2). Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or encourage men defending a castle. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the grounds of an existing temple of the same faith. The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level. The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of earth from a grave."

Sand and snow are loose enough that another creature should be able to easily remove the blade, but hard packed earth or clay might require a strength check to be removed. Ground in-between these may require a strength check with a bonus subject to DM discretion. Targets that do not see the spell coming, fleeing targets for example, make their saves at -2. For each size difference to the caster (larger or smaller), the target of the spell receives a cumulative +2 bonus to their save. If the shadow leaves the blade (lighting changes for example) the spell is broken. Whether the subject of the spell is able to reach, grasp, and withdraw the blade is dependent upon the circumstances. The blade is ~3' long and is all but fully sunk into the ground, leaving the handle near to the ground.

The priest affects a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM option). Magical or enchanted stone cannot be affected by this spell, nor can dressed or worked stone. Creatures attempting to move through an area softened into mud are reduced to a move of 10 feet per round. Any creatures caught within the mud when the spell takes effect must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose the ability to move, attack, or cast spells for 1d2 rounds as they flounder about in the muck. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, and creatures are only reduced to half their normal movement rate, with no chance of being caught for a round or two. However, it is impossible to run, sprint, or charge over either surface. Restore Strength Soften Earth and Stone Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall. While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. The material component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master potter."

A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer.

On the round immediately following, the victim begins smiling, then giggling, chuckling, tittering, snickering, guffawing, and finally collapsing into gales of uncontrollable, hideous laughter.  Although this magical mirth lasts only a single round, the affected creature must spend the next round regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points from its Strength (or -2 to attack and damage rolls) for all remaining rounds of the spell.  The saving throw vs. spell is modified by the Intelligence of the creature. Creatures with Intelligences of 4 or less (semi-intelligent) are totally unaffected. Those with Intelligences of 5-7 (low) save with -6 penalties. Those with Intelligences of 8-12 (average to very) save with -4 penalties. Those with Intelligences of 13-14 (high) save with -2 penalties. Those with Intelligences of 15 or greater (exceptional) have unmodified saving throws. The caster can affect one creature for every three levels attained - for example, one at 3rd level, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, etc. All affected beings must be within 30 feet of each other. The material components are a small feather and minute tarts. The tarts are hurled at the subjects, while the feather is waved in one hand."

The spell causes the object to rise slightly off the ground or floor it is resting on to trip most creatures crossing it, if they fail their saving throws vs. spell. Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the enchanted object. Thus, a 3-foot-long piece of rope could trip only one man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is turf or other soft material, they are merely stunned for the rest of that round). Very large creatures, such as elephants, are not affected at all by a trip spell. The object continues to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spellcaster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware of the object and its potential adds a +4 bonus to its saving throw roll when crossing the object. The enchanted object is 80% undetectable unless a means that detects magical traps is employed or the operation of the spell is observed. This spell does not function under water."

		"description": "A necromancer must touch a willing subject in the casting of this spell, turning their muscles into undead muscles, raising their strength temporarily. The subject of the spell makes an exchange of HP for Strength. For every HP they lose, they temporarily gain 1 point of strength, to a maximum of 18/100 (each category of exceptional strength counts as 1 point). Non-warriors can gain exceptional strength this way. When the duration expires, the subject reverts to their normal strength, and then loses an equal amount to what they gained. The lost strength returns at a rate of 1 point per day. It is worth keeping in mind, that any character who reaches 0 strength dies. Example: Lili the Cleric is fighting a giant with her necromancer friend Leoric. Leoric casts Unholy Strength on Lili, who chooses to give up 11 hp, raising her strength from 12 to 18/100. When the spell expires after defeating the giant, Lili looses 11 points of strength, bringing her to 1 strength. The next morning, she has regained 1 lost point of strength and is at 2 str. Three days later, she's at 5 strength. A week later, she's back at her full 12 strength.  Non-willing subjects, including unconscious people, cannot be targeted with the spell, as part of the magic involves an internal agreement to relinquish HP. Similarly, the muscles of the subject are decayed and undead, giving the subject of the spell a stench of death and decay about them. "

The range of a warp wood spell is 10 yards for each level of experience of the caster. It affects approximately a 15- inch shaft of wood of up to 1-inch diameter per level of the caster. Thus, at 1st level, a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, he could warp the shaft of a typical spear. Note that boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are useless; warped melee weapons suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls. Enchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher, 40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. Wooden magical items are considered enchanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaffected by this spell. The reversed spell, straighten wood, straightens bent or crooked wood, or reverses the effects of a warp wood spell, subject to the same restrictions."

The first version of this spell enchants the wards permanently, while the second version permits their use. Two masks must be created, one that looks outward, and one that looks inward. The outward facing mask has the shape of a person, animal, or monster as seen by another person - a typical face. The masks that look in are shaped as if to be donned, but must also match the outward mask. When the wizard 'wears' the inward mask and casts the spell they see as if their face was the outward mask. They cannot move the outward mask, but may move the eyes, which might be noticed by someone observing the outward mask. The second version of the spell has a duration of 1 round / level, during which time the wizard may switch between various masks if they have more than one. Should a mask be damaged, it may cease to function. This is checked the first time the mask is used after being damaged. A mask 10% damaged has a 10% chance of failing. If this check is passed, it will continue to function until further damaged. Damage to the gems that function as eyes destroyed the magic."

The pseudopod can stretch up to 10 feet plus 1 foot per caster level from its source, so a 3rd-level priest could command watery fist to strike at a creature hovering thirteen feet above a lake or standing on the shore 13 feet from the water. The pseudopod obeys the priest's mental commands, although the priest must concentrate each round in order to maintain control of the watery member. The pseudopod is incapable of fine manipulation, but it can be used to make bludgeoning or constricting attacks. When used to strike at opponents, it attacks with the caster's THAC0 and inflicts damage as shown below. The priest may add his magical attack adjustment (from his Wisdom score) to his THAC0, but Strength-based adjustments or special weapon skills don't help the priest to control watery fist. The pseudopod may be able to make rear or flank attacks if the priest can direct it into the proper position. If used to encircle and constrict, the pseudopod must first make an attack roll as described above, inflicting damage based on the priest's level. However, in following rounds, the pseudopod automatically strikes its grappled target for constricting damage, +1 point per round of constricting. In other words, in the first round the victim sustains listed damage, in the second round he sustains listed damage +1, in the third he sustains listed damage +2, and so on. The pseudopod holds its target with an effective Strength equal to the priest's Wisdom score. Watery fist can be released by the priest any time he cares to stop concentrating on maintaining it. The pseudopod immediately resumes its normal state, possibly drenching a grappled creature or extinguishing a small fire if the caster wishes. The pseudopod is AC 6 and has 15 hp plus 1 hp per caster level, but it can only be damaged by magical weapons, fire, or cold; all other attacks simply pass through the water. Transmute water to dust, part water, lower water, and Otiluke's freezing sphere all destroy watery fist on contact.

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the web collapses upon itself and disappears. The web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10' x 10' x 10' cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers.  Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs. Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round. Furthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed. The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web."

He can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as a mile per hour or as quickly as a mile per turn.

Note that while affected by the withdraw spell, the caster can use only the following spells: any divination spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter on himself only. The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example, a cure light wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible, or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like.

Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell.

If the roll is missed, the caster cannot comprehend what he has learned and the information is immediately forgotten. If the spell is cast a second time on the same substance, the spell automatically fails unless the wizard has advanced to the next experience level. The caster's level determines the type of information gleaned: 5th Level: The type and quantity of ingredients and the preparation process required to produce a non-magical mixture are learned. For example, the wizard could learn how to produce Greek fire or gunpowder, or could learn the recipe for something simple, like chocolate cake. 9th Level: The wizard may learn the proper ingredients and formula for making a magical liquid (potion, scroll ink, etc.). 14th Level: The caster may learn the formula for creating any type of magical object, excluding unique items and objects of extreme power (artifacts and relics). In all cases, simply knowing the proper formula does not mean the wizard can successfully create the item or material. The construction of alchemical mixtures and magical items is a time consuming and expensive undertaking. This spell has detrimental effects on the magical item analyzed. Single-use items (potions, oils, etc.) are automatically destroyed; the spell consumes the item in the process of analyzing it. Reusable magical items must make a saving throw vs. disintegration.

Alternatively, when Malakai the Sorcerer casts this spell on house, he could name himself, Van-Healsing the Cleric of Chis, and Kain the Ranger as those that may enter, and the same people plus Jeeves the driver as those who may exit. Specific people to be granted access must be known and named. The caster must have an accurate mental image of the person, they may not be known by rough description or a painting. Having met or scryed (with something like Clairvoyance) upon the person is accurate enough. Further discriminations similar to those found in the Magic Mouth spell can be made. 'Myself and Goblin women weight over 200lb, carrying a curved sword, and singing their national anthem in ogre may enter, anybody may exit' would be a successful casting.

The material component is a small, unmarked die."

		"description": "This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note that this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved. The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting this spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it frequently."

Each creature within 30 feet of the caster makes a saving throw (dex suggested), if they fail they take an amount of damage equal to the difference between their failed save and what they needed to succeed. Furthermore, characters in magical or metal armor suffer a damage reduction of half. Characters wielding a shield, and facing the caster may add 5 to their save. Example: Diana the Invoker casts Arcane Blast at a hobgoblin warlord. Diana rolls a d20+21 (15 Int, level 3) and rolls a natural 20, for a combined roll of 41. The hobgoblin warlord rolls a d20+18 (12 Dex, level 3) and rolls a natural 2, for a combined roll of 20. The difference between the two is 21, so the hobgoblin warlord takes maximum damage of 20. Were the warlord to be wearing chain mail, the damage would be reduced to 10.

The astral window ranges in size from one square foot up to a 10'x10' square, at the caster's choosing. The window is not mobile, and if the priest moves more than 5 yards away from it, it immediately vanishes and the spell ends. By stating a subject's name, the priest may view a specific creature or object in the window. More than one subject may be viewed during the spell's duration. Each time a new subject is chosen, the window becomes streaked with grey as the Astral plane flies past. This continues for 1d4 rounds, until the window finally focuses upon the chosen subject. If the person is not in the Astral plane, the window instead chooses a random location. The window operates from both sides; creatures in the Astral plane can see the priest as easily as he can see them. Verbal communication is not possible, however. Normally, creatures cannot pass through the window. If an attempt is made, there is a base 5% chance of success. This is modified by +1% per level or Hit Dice of the individual. In order to pass through, the creature or object must be small enough to fit through the window; otherwise, only a portion of the subject may reach through (such as a monster's arm or searching tongue). By casting the astral window spell, a character who subsequently casts the 7th-level astral spell may choose to arrive in the Astral plane at the place shown in the window."

The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to elude capture, with a -1 penalty per three caster levels (for example, -1 for a 4th to 6th level caster, -2 for a 7th to 9th level caster, -3 for a 10th to 12th level caster, and so on), since higher-level casters tend to conjure more bands in a denser pattern.

		"description": "By means of this spell, the wizard causes his material form to 'blink' directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked. Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink - the result of the dice roll is used as the wizards initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by roll of ld8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 left ahead, 8 = ahead.)  The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal plane. During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (e.g., with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster. If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal ldl0 initiative roll (thus he probably attacks last in the round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll.  If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then he attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).

The caster is then able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The caster need not call a bolt of lightning immediately--other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed; however, the caster must remain stationary and concentrate for a full round each time a bolt is called. The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8+4d8). The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever distance the spellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes suffers full damage unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case only one-half damage is taken. Because it requires a storm overhead, this spell can only be used outdoors. It does not function under ground or under water."

The first are of small size and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry units. Each time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD4 (for infantry caltrops) or AD6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area suffer double damage. If a unit ends its movement in a caltrop-sown region, it suffers another attack when it moves out of the area. This spell can create a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 160 square yards in area (e.g., 4 yards x 40 yards, 2 yards x 80 yards, etc.), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to 90 square yards in area (e.g., 3 yards x 30 yards, 2 yards x 45 yards, etc.). Ordinary caltrops make no distinction between friend or foe; all creatures entering a caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences. The same is true of magical caltrops, with one exception: the casting priest can terminate the spell at any time, causing the caltrops to vanish and leaving the terrain clear. Unlike normal caltrops, a region sown with magical caltrops cannot be 'swept' clear; the magical caltrops remain in place until the spell terminates. The material component is a golden caltrop."

If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.

Ordering an animal to engage in combat is not necessarily self-destructive, as long as the prospective opponent is not more than three times the animal's Hit Dice or more than two size categories larger than the subject. For example, a wolf (3 Hit Dice, size M) would attack a troll (6+6 Hit Dice, size L) without hesitation, but it might break free of the caster's control if ordered to attack a size H dragon or an 8+8 HD umber hulk. Control animal establishes a mental link between the caster and the subject, and the animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains within range. Because the caster's intelligence directs the animal, the creature may be able to take actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its paws and mouth. The caster need not concentrate in order to maintain control of the creature unless he is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't. Control animal only works on normal or giant-sized animals with Intelligence ratings between 1 and 4.

The servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%. Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this. The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete. The servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise, the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of the designated campsite).

If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within the environmental limitations. The servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions other than creating the campsite.

To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical: Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks. Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of Charisma, permanently.

The creature whose aura has been assumed radiates magic, but the wizard radiates magic only to the creature whose alignment has been assumed.  If a delude spell is used in conjunction with a change self or alter self spell, the class of the wizard can be totally hidden, if he is clever enough to carry off the disguise."

		"description": "Originally developed by the Harmonium faction of the Outer Planes, this useful spell has come into more widespread use in recent years. While the spell is available as a 2nd-level enchantment for members of the Harmonium, the general version is not quite as efficient and is considered a 3rd-level spell. The dictate spell is an improved version of command, affecting up to 6 creatures in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws must attempt to obey the caster's instructions. For example, a priest could issue a dictate such as 'Stay here until I return,' 'Throw down your weapons,' or 'Seize that elf!' The subjects will continue to obey non-immediate orders for up to one round per experience level of the caster. Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do not understand the caster's language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must Detect Spirits Dictate create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to 'Die!' or 'Feel sorry for him!' would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on their saving throws at the DM's discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving throw he is given an obviously self-destructive dictate, the subject simply loses his next round as he fights off the compulsion."

		"description": "When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows: First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast.  Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).  Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (thus making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, then the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect, otherwise it is automatically rendered nonoperational.  An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: a nonoperational magical sword is still a sword. Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DMs option. Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions. Similar to Identify and picking locks, a failure to dispel means that it cannot be dispelled until the caster has gained a level."

		"description": "This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest. The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed. This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell. If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion. The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects. Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear. Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage. Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate. Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked. Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness. Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship. Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness. Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope. Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty. The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness. All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell. The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting."

The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 cubic feet - thirty-three 10' x 10' x 10' cubes). Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball. The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast.  Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage (the DM rolls the damage and each affected creature suffers either full damage or half damage [round fractions down], depending on whether the creature saved or not).

Creatures defending the dike receive 50% cover against missile fire (+4 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike.

In hand-to-hand combat, the wall's defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls; man-sized attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category, as well. C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra, fortify cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 10 feet wide and 2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to negotiate the ditch, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side. The fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and excavations, clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original state. The material component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold pieces worth of diamond powder.

Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18- foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible. The priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth). Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by onehalf or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill. The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules."

The caster can command it to locate a character or creature of the caster's choice based on a physical description. The caster can specify race, sex, and appearance, but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. After the hand receives its orders, it begins to search for the indicated creature, flying at a movement rate of 48. The hand can search within a 5-mile radius of the caster. If the hand is unable to locate the indicated creature, it returns to the caster (provided he is still within the area of effect). The hand displays an outstretched palm, indicating that no such character or creature could be found. The hand then disappears. If the hand locates the indicated subject, the hand beckons the subject to follow it. If the subject follows, the hand points in the direction of the caster, leading the subject in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before him. Once the hand leads the subject to the caster, it disappears. The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or help the caster. If the subject chooses not to follow the hand, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to the caster, the hand disappears; the subject will have to rely on his own devices to locate the caster. If there is more than one subject within a 5-mile radius that meets the caster's description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand will not seek out a second subject. The ghostly hand has no physical form. The hand can be seen only by the caster and potential targets. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating the subject and leading him back to the caster. The hand will not pass through solid objects, but can pass through small cracks and slits. The material component is a black silk glove."

The mirror must be of a size to hold the creature. Spells that change the size of the creature prevent the creature from being entombed until the spell is worn off. Similarly, mirrors that are magically changed in size are unsuitable for this task. Once a creature is held in a mirror, it is in a state of two dimensional semi-stasis. The creature does not heal, does not age, has no need of food, drink, or bodily functions, yet they may still move and speak (if they were able to outside of the mirror). Furthermore, those trapped in the mirror find that their three dimensional belongings no longer function in two dimensional space: books cannot be read, potions cannot be consumed, itches cannot be scratched, etc. Creatures with magical abilities (spells, gazes, etc.) will find that their spells are restricted to the mirror dimension in which they are placed. A basilisk would not petrify someone looking at it, nor could a mage within a mirror cast Magic Missile at someone on the other side or at the mirror itself. Creatures inside the mirror are aware of what is happening on the outside of the mirror, being able to see, hear, and smell. Similarly, creatures on the outside of the mirror and see and hear those trapped within. Those inside the mirror may walk around within the confines of the mirror, and may come into the foreground (between the onlooker and their reflection) or stay in the background (behind the reflection of creatures).  If the mirror is broken or damaged (scratching the glass counts as damaged), the magic is broken, the mirror shatters, and the creature is freed, in the exact state it was originally imprisoned. A shatter spell cast from within the mirror dimension will break the mirror. Spells that move between dimensions can be used as long as they do not require 3 dimensional space (A spell that opens a portal one walks through would not work, but a spell that shifts the caster from one dimension to another will). Teleportation has no effect. A caster may not imprison themselves in a mirror."

Secondly, if the protected doorway is forced open by any means, magical or physical, the sign is not only destroyed, but also strikes the offending creature for 1d8 points of damage +1 point of damage per level of the caster. The duration of this spell is either one day per level of the caster or until discharged, whichever happens first. The exact form of energy is chosen by the caster when he creates the lesser sign; acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic disruption are popular choices. The sign is not hidden or concealed in any way and is usually quite prominent on the item or portal it protects. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the lesser sign's operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it (except for extraplanar creatures of 6HD or more and wizards of higher level than the caster - they can merely ignore it as if it were not there). The sign cannot be dispelled by spells of lower spell level such as Knock, but the caster can remove it at any time he chooses, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by an erase spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster. The material component for a lesser sign can be a pinch of either powdered diamond (cold), ruby (fire), emerald (acid), pearl (sonic disruption), or sapphire (electricity), depending on the type of energy the wizard wishes the sign to employ. The value of the gemstone must be at least 100gp."

		"description": "Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40).  The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1/2 foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze).  Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch of wood or 1/2 inch of stone per caster level up to a maximum of one foot of wood or 1/2 foot of stone.  The lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt five feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length. Example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!). The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made). The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod."

		"description": "This cooperative spell requires at least two priests to cast the spell simultaneously. During the casting, the priests determine whether the line will be stationary or portable. If the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on parallel facing surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If the spell is portable, the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby anchoring it. After the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two anchors (the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with energy. Objects on the opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable, are hazy and indistinct. The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage. If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field. Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell. As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern. The material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious standards, held aloft by each caster. The reverse of this spell, line of destruction, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage to paladins and creatures of good alignment who pass through it. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage."

		"description": "This spell is coupled with the second level Beacon spell to get the location of a specific beacon. The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting. If the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon. When a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1' in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city. A map of that city might reveal the beacon is in a neighborhood or perhaps a specific building, depending on specific circumstances. The map must be well made, well informed, accurate, and precise. Maps of this quality are often at least 100gp in value.  Beacon and Locate Beacon are often used by powerful merchants and nobles to track larges shipments of money. A single coin may be made a beacon, tossed in with the rest, and if the shipment doesn't get to where it was heading, can be tracked down hopefully before too much is spent or distributed."

The shell has HP equal to 5x the caster level and can block up to half of its remaining hp in damage to any single attack.  Example: a 40hp shell could block a 10 damage attack, a 5 damage attack, and then a 8 damage attack (leaving it at 17 hp). If the next attack were to do 9 points of damage, the shell would be broken and the subject would take 1 point of damage (half of 17 rounded down is 8, so the 1 extra damage goes through to the target). The shell only blocks kinetic attacks (including falling), so breath weapons, fire, acid, etc. are not obstructed. Furthermore, the shell is activated when attacks come within the area of the shell, so it will trigger on missed attacks that roll at least a modified 10, or on attacks that must past through the shell's space, e.g. missile attacks at creatures behind one with magic shell.  Whenever subjected to an attack, the whole shield becomes visible as a spherical grid. The visibility of the shield decreases as its HP decreases.

The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, with the variable part of the duration rolled secretly by the DM.

It can also ignite combustible materials (even solid planks).  The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenade-like missiles that inflict 1 point of damage to creatures within three feet. The spell can be cast in either of two ways: A) The wizard discharges five meteors every round (see the 'Multiple Attacks and Initiative' section in Chapter 9: Combat). Note that this carries over into at least the following round. B) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can perform other actions in the round, including spellcasting, melee, or device use. Spells requiring concentration force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles to maintain concentration.  Also, if the wizard fails to maintain an exact mental count of the number of missiles he has remaining, he has involuntarily lost the remaining portion of the spell. The spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as he has experience levels, when he forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful dispel magic spell is thrown upon the caster. The components necessary for the casting of this spell are niter and sulphur formed into a bead by the addition of pine tar.

Creatures within 20' must make a strength check to stay on their feet. If there is nowhere for the air to go, for example if the portal is opened in a sealed room, the pressure in the room raises, but there is no wind. If opened in a hallway or other restricted space the effects are intensified, possibly knocking creatures back.  Plane of Water: 3000' cubic feet (30 x 10 x 10) of fresh water burst forth from the portal.

Plane of Earth: Considering that the plane of earth is solid material, this spell effectively creates a very short lived solid wall. There is a very small, but non-zero, chance that the portal opens near a denizen of the plane, which may accidentally or intentionally be swept through the portal and into existence. This creature is not bound in any way. DMs should be careful in deciding if and what ever comes through the portal. A portal drawn at half the size would produce ¼ the volume, so a halfling opening a portal to the Plane of Water would produce 1500 cubic feet of water."

The result of moment reading will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of 'vicinity' will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the moment might be 'severe danger' if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight. The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he's currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance). One casting of this spell tends to 'taint' subsequent castings of the same spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest's use of the spell, he receives an accurate reading. The material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone engraved with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the casting."

		"description": "This spell affords the caster or touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as shadows, wights, wraiths, spectres, or vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The negative plane protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane, possibly offsetting the effect of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic. If successful, the energies cancel with a bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The protected creature suffers only normal hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience or Strength, regardless of the number of levels the attack would have drained. An attacking undead creature suffers 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy; a draining wizard or weapon receives no damage. This protection is proof against only one such attack, dissipating immediately whether or not the saving throw was successful. If the saving throw is failed, the spell recipient suffers double the usual physical damage, in addition to the loss of experience or Strength that normally occurs. The protection lasts for one turn per level of the priest casting the spell, or until the protected creature is struck by a negative energy attack. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy plane."

Note, however, that the mount cannot casually take off and fly; the movement must be between points of similar altitude.  14th Level: The ability to perform as if it were a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per round upon command. Note that a mount's abilities include those of lower levels; thus a 12th-level mount has the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-level abilities. "

The first causes normal vegetation to grow, entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through at a movement rate of 10 feet per round (or 20 feet per round for larger-than-man-sized creatures). Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of experience of the caster, in any square or rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such magical means as a dispel magic spell. The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods, drought, fire, or insects, although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season, the winter 'death' marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees.

A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form.

The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)--roll each round. It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.

It can be used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the working of the spell. Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre's club. The blow inflicts 12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran's current hit points drop from 32 to 11 after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the effects of the injury. When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran's aid. Using repair injury, he knits Beran's broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44. Repair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed, shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell. Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding."

		"description": "Rigid thinking can be cast only upon a creature with Intelligence of 3 or greater. The creature is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects. The creature affected by rigid thinking is in capable of performing any action other than the activity he is involved in when the spell takes effect. The creature's mind simply cannot decide on another course of action--it becomes frozen into a single thought and cannot change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior fighting a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will pay no heed to the arrival of three guards. The affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an automaton. He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of arrows, but will choose another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of all other activities. A spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when rigid thinking takes effect will not attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been memorized more than once). The spellcaster will, however, devote his attention to the target of that spell until his goal is met (e.g., if the caster were attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at that creature; if the caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the door until it opens). The spell expires when the creature accomplishes his goal (i.e., the kobold is killed or the lock is opened) or when the duration of the spell has ended."

When the door is opened, the magic is temporarily suspended. This spell confers no extra protections against traditional opening and closing. To prepare the door, the caster must fill all the cracks, gaps, and holes in a doorway with some form of animal fat or blubber. When the gaps are filled (to air tight), the caster may finish the spell which causes the components to vanish. A normal door takes ~10 minutes to properly seal with blubber. The door will forever have the faint odor of the animal fat it was sealed with. Expensive rendered fat from particular species that produce no smells can be purchased for 100gp / standard door. "

Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of his surroundings. If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in a flash of brown light, with a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one round. The spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the entire page of text. It can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text. The components for the spell are 100 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores."

When the snare spell is cast upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings. One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could be thus ensnared). If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, inflicting 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped, and lifting it off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available, the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s), then wraps around the entire creature, causing no damage, but tightly binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its anchor point. The snare is magical, so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour--22 after two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four--until six full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18 Strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of the snare lose all magical properties and the loop opens, freeing anything it held. The snare can be cut with any magical weapon, or with any edged weapon wielded with at least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for example). The caster must have a snake skin and a piece of sinew from a strong animal to weave into the cordlike object from which he will make the snare. Only the caster's holy symbol is otherwise needed."

Up to one square foot of surface area per caster level can be affected, so a 5th-level caster can affect 5 square feet - enough to create a 2-foot by 3-foot hole in a door or wall, or thoroughly drench a man-sized creature. The acid eats through 6 inches of wood, leather, or bone, 4 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal each round.  Against monsters composed of stone, metal or wood, the solvent inflicts 1d3 points of damage per caster level in the first round, 1d2 per caster level in the second round, and 1 per two caster levels in the third and final round.  Therefore, a 10th-level wizard who strikes a Treant with solvent of corrosion inflicts 10d3, then 10d2 and finally 5 points of damage. Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. Against flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does inflict a -2 penalty to the victim's attacks while the solvent is active.  The solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive damage to the victim's armor and equipment; item saving throws vs. acid may apply at the DM's discretion. If the armor or equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throws is made with the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item. The great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such hazards. The solvent's effectiveness against mineral or wood-based creatures was a mere side effect of his research. The material component of this spell is a mixture of vinegar, water, and a drop of black dragon acid."

This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after which the character's normal movement rate is regained. Without the use of a spell such as true seeing, similar magical aids, or some other special means of detection (such as detect traps or detect snares and pits), an area affected by spike growth is absolutely undetectable as such until a victim enters the area and suffers damage.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.  However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizards party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power. The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above.  Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, then the action will not be performed.  If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect.

		"description": "This spell summons a minor spirit or entity to the caster's aid. Clerics usually summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit's origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some kind-wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The animal spirit obeys the mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind. In combat, the animal spirit has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0 15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the caster's level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a animal spirit with 16 hit points. The creature is not affected by charm, sleep, hold, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to dispel magic or turning as an undead monster of the caster's Hit Dice. If the animal spirit is turned, destroyed, or dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Because the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster's direction, the priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks-an animal spirit could be ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into hand-to-hand combat. The animal spirit makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the animal spirit and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell's range; if it is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly. The material component is a small whistle carved from a bone taken from the appropriate type of animal."

The essence bursts into flame, which the caster then reaches through to pull out an individual of that type who is then bound to the caster's will. Casters cannot summon specific individuals with this spell, and mindless/soulless creatures cannot be bound (jellies, undead, etc.). This spell does not bring any weapons, armor, or equipment that the creature wasn't already wearing. The caster must physically touch the creature when it pulls it through the flame, but the creature does not appear held in the caster's hand. Instead it appears wherever desired within 10' of the caster. Creatures that cannot understand the caster will simply attack whoever the caster indicates and cannot be called off once sent to attack. Creatures that can understand the cater will obey verbal commands to the best of their ability, but will not be self destructive. A goblin might be ordered to charge a dragon, but it will not throw itself off a cliff. The creature, upon being summoned, may make a check to burst the casters dominance on them. Both sides roll a d10+wil+levelx2 (or hit dice if level is not available), and if the creature meets or beats the caster, the creature is free. Semi-magical creatures get a +5 bonus to their roll, magical creatures get a +10, highly magical creatures get a +15. Natural 1s and 20s have no effect on this roll. If the creature successfully bursts the spell, it becomes free willed and usually very angry at the summoner, who it will probably try to destroy. Creatures that are bound may be dismissed with a gesture and a sound."

Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost. The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed. It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water. The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol, a flower petal, and a bit of mud or wet clay."

		"description": "This spell establishes direct, two-way mental contact between the priest and a single subject. The subject must have Intelligence of at least 5 for the spell to take effect. While the spell is in effect, the two participants can communicate silently and rapidly, regardless of whether they share a common language. Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or emotions. Participants can only 'hear' the thoughts that the other participant actively 'sends.' Mind-to-mind communication is approximately four times faster than verbal communication. The level of complexity that can be communicated is only that which can be expressed through language. Gestures, expressions, and body language cannot be conveyed. A priest can establish separate 'telepathic channels' to multiple individuals. Each linkage is established through a separate casting of the spell. There is no network between the channels. For example, Balfas the priest establishes telepathy with Alra the warrior and Zymor the thief by casting this spell twice. Balfas can communicate a single thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each other. Balfas, however, can 'target' a thought so that only one of the two participants receives it. If the priest casts this spell on an unwilling subject (for example, if the priest wants to silently threaten or taunt the subject), the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effect. Willing subjects need not make a saving throw. Lead sheeting of more than _ ' thickness will totally block telepathy."

		"description": "This spell requires the priest to perform a numerological analysis of a subject's correct name. The result is that the priest may cast another spell that affects the subject individual at a range much greater than normal. In other words, by gaining deep knowledge of the individual, the priest creates a 'channel' to that individual that makes a subsequent spell easier to cast on that subject. Only certain spells can benefit from telethaumaturgy: bless* command charm person or mammal detect charm hold person know alignment remove curse* probability control quest confusion (one creature only) exaction For spells marked with an asterisk (*), telethaumaturgy also increases the range of the reversed spell. Unless indicated, telethaumaturgy does not increase the range of the reversed spells. The increase in range depends on the level of the priest casting telethaumaturgy: Level Range Multiplier 1-6 x2 7-11 x3 12-16 x4 17+ x5 Thus, a 12th-level priest who has cast telethaumaturgy on an individual could subsequently cast charm person on that individual at a range of 320 yards, rather than the normal range of 80 yards. A spell to be enhanced by telethaumaturgy must be cast on the round immediately following the completion of telethaumaturgy. Spells that normally affect more than one individual (such as confusion ) will affect only the selected subject when cast following telethaumaturgy. When telethaumaturgy is cast by a priest of 11th level or higher, it has an additional effect. If the target is within the normal range of the subsequent spell (e.g., 80 yards for charm person), the subject's saving throw suffers a penalty of -2. Like the personal reading spell, telethaumaturgy functions only if the priest knows the correct name of his subject. If the priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not know that telethaumaturgy has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails. The priest does not automatically know why the subsequent spell failed (the subject might simply have made a successful saving throw). The material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes. This book is different from the book used in personal reading. The book is not consumed in the casting"

Each creature that is to understand must have their ears touched by the caster, while each of the creatures that is to be understood must have their mouth (or origin of their speech) touched. All subjects of the spell need to be smeared with ink on their forehead (or equivalent) by the caster, and the caster must continue intoning the words to the spell as they move between recipients. During the casting of the spell, none of the recipients that have been marked may leave the AOE, else their ink fades and they are removed from the spell's effects. It is possible to have 2 people who can speak and 10 people who can listen. When the spell ends, which happens when the duration expires, the caster cancels it, or the caster's light concentration is broken, the ink fades from each of the subjects of the spell. Example: A diviner wishes to hold an audience with a goblin queen and his party. The goblin queen does not speak common, so the diviner touches the ears of the party members, himself, and the queen, while touching the lips of the queen and himself. All are marked with ink. When the spell takes effect, the goblin will only understand the caster, while the party will understand the goblin. This way the party (caster not included) can speak in common without the goblin understanding, but all can understand the goblin."

		"description": "By anticipating possible futures and outcomes of the caster's actions, this spell provides the character with a temporary sixth sense or feel for danger. The spell operates on a subconscious level, and the caster receives strong intuitive impulses when he contemplates courses of action that may bring immediate physical injury or harm to him. For example, if the priest was about to open a trapped chest, the unfailing premonition would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn't do so. Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the spell's warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to respond by drawing a weapon and attacking the PC would create a warning, but threatening a NPC who will get even with the priest in an hour or two will not trigger the premonition. The unfailing premonition is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest obeys his instincts and ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to. While the spell is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his intended action in order to obey the spell's warning impulses. The premonition only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself. If his companion is about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone on the priest, he receives no warning."

The wall lasts as long as the wizard chooses to concentrate on maintaining it or one round per level if the wizard chooses not to concentrate on holding it together. The caster may shape the wall of water in one of three ways: A. Water Curtain. In this form, the wizard conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five 5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of water 1 foot thick. The curtain's lower edge must rest upon the ground, but need not be anchored on either side, and it remains cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the wall cannot be moved. B. Hemisphere. In this manifestation, the wall of water forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a 7th level caster could create a dome with a 10 foot radius. The wall must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile. C. Sphere. If cast underwater, the caster may shape the wall of water into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him. In any form, the wall of water has two primary effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to impossible, suffering a -4 attack penalty for each foot of thickness as well as -1 damage penalty for every two feet of thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving throw, none is granted by the wall of water. Secondly, physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to the skin in the process. The wall of water can be defeated or bypassed by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell's duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to the curtain. Note the water itself may be fresh water (25% chance), salt water (50% chance) or brackish (25% chance), although the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds it.

If the watery double succeeds in touching the creature, it merges with the individual, covering his entire body in a skin of liquid. The victim must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature has resisted the spell's effect and the watery double 'dies,' becoming normal fluid (and soaking the creature in the process). If the saving throw is failed, the watery double begins forcing its way into the victim's body, inflicting Id8 points of damage per round until it is destroyed. The watery double dissipates if reduced to zero hit points or when the spell's duration expires. Striking the watery double while it is wrapped around its victim causes an equal amount of damage to the victim. Part water, lower water, and transmute water to dust spells instantly destroy a watery double."

		"description": "This spell allows the priest to exert fine control over air currents and winds, possibly extinguishing small fires or manipulating light objects as he sees fit within the spell's range. Generally, the priest is limited to one discrete action per round since he must focus his wind servant tightly on any given task. The wind servant can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship's sail or a bird in flight. If an object is within the spell's weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell's range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the wind servant against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of -4 to the attack roll. In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent's base AC less 2d6 points and creates a -2 penalty to the victim's attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 - 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell. Note that any use of the wind servant requires the priest's undivided attention; he can take no other actions while directing the spell."

This spell does not reveal the presence of good or evil or reveal alignment. While wizard sight is in effect, a wizard is able to see whether someone is a spellcaster and whether that person is a priest or a wizard (and what type of specialist, if any). He can sense if a nonspellcaster has the potential to learn and cast wizard spells (e.g., whether a fighter will someday gain the ability to cast a spell). Although a spellcaster's level cannot be discerned, the wizard can see the intensity of a spellcaster's aura and guess at the individual's magical power (dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). This can be extremely ambiguous even when a wizard has some method of comparison; the DM might announce that a subject's intensity is roughly equivalent to that of a companion, or he might announce that a subject's aura is the strongest the wizard has ever encountered. An object's magical abilities cannot be discerned. The fact that it is magical and the type of magic (abjuration, alteration, etc.) are obvious. The wizard can see the intensity of an item's magical aura and guess at its power, but cannot tell whether a magical item is cursed."

		"description": "The philosophy of the Sphere of Numbers holds that the structure of reality--the 'equation of the moment'--can be analyzed and modified by someone with sufficient knowledge and power. The addition spell allows a priest to add a new mathematical term to the equation of the moment. This effectively allows a new object or even a living creature to be brought into existence temporarily. The effect of this spell varies depending on the level of the caster. At 10th level or lower, addition can create a single, inanimate object weighing up to 10 pounds. The spell gives the priest only rudimentary control over the creation process, so the object cannot be complex. The object must be described in a single word or short phrase (e.g., 'a water pitcher' or 'a block of stone'). The caster has no control over elements such as shape or color; thus, the water pitcher might be short, squat, and blue, or tall, slender, and red. Objects created with this spell cannot be of any greater mechanical complexity or technological level than a crossbow. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, the spell fails and nothing is created. Thus, if the priest tried to create 'a pistol,' assuming he had heard the word somewhere, the spell would fail. Objects cannot contain any information in an abstract form such as writing or diagrams. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, there are two possible results: the spell may fail, or the object may be created without the information. Thus, if the priest were to attempt to create 'a spellbook,' the result would be either a book similar to a spellbook with blank pages, or nothing at all. The object appears at whatever location the caster wills, as long as it is within spell range. The object cannot appear in the same space occupied by another object or creature, or within a hollow object (for example, the priest cannot create an object blocking the trachea of an enemy). The object created by addition remains in existence for 1 turn per level of the caster. During this time, it obeys all the laws of physics as if it were a 'real' object. The object cannot be disbelieved and spells such as true seeing cannot distinguish it from a naturally-occurring object. Priests of 11th to 15th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 20 pounds in mass or two identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) so created remains in existence for two hours (12 turns) per level of the caster. Priests of 16th to 19th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 50 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) is permanent unless destroyed. Since these objects are not magical constructs, but real additions to the 'equation of the moment,' dispel magic has no effect on them. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 20 pounds in weight. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 5 rounds per level of the caster. Priests of 20th level and above can create a single inanimate object of up to 100 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to 10 pounds in mass. The object(s) are permanent. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 100 pounds in weight and up to 2 hit dice. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 2 turns per level of the caster. The material component is a small table of numerological formulae inscribed on an ivory plaque, plus a length of silken cord. During the casting, the priest ties the cord into a complex knot. As the magical energy is discharged, the cord vanishes in a flash of light. The plaque is not consumed in the casting."

The change in age, either forward or backward, is chosen by the priest at the time of casting. The changes associated with normal or reversed growth occur instantaneously. Plants can be altered in age up to 10 years per level of the caster. The caster can stop the aging at any point within the limits imposed by his level; he could cause a tree to grow from a sapling until it withers and dies from old age or he could stop the tree's growth at a stage at which it would shelter his home. The spell does not alter the appearance or characteristics of a plant except those that result from normal aging (or regression).

The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc.)."

Characters wielding a shield, and facing the blast may add 2 to their save. Example: Diana the Invoker casts Arcane Bomb at a hobgoblin warlord. Diana rolls a d20+21 (15 Int, level 3) and rolls a natural 20, for a combined roll of 41. The hobgoblin warlord rolls a d20+18 (12 Dex, level 3) and rolls a natural 2, for a combined roll of 20.

The caster begins the incantation and continues uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have elapsed.

They come only if they are within the range of the call. The caster can call three times, for a different type each time. Once a call is successful, no other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The DM will consult his outdoor map or base the probability of any such creature being within spell range upon the nature of the area the caster is in at the time of spellcasting.) The creature(s) called by the spell are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a -4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any woodland beings answering the call are favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they are capable of. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment, the creatures are entitled to another saving throw vs. spell (this time with a +4 bonus) when they come within 10 yards of the caster or another evil character with him. These beings immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In any event, if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on his behalf, they are required to roll a loyalty reaction check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had with them. This spell works with respect to neutral or good woodland creatures, as determined by the DM. Thus, the DM can freely add to or alter the list as he sees fit. If the caster personally knows a certain individual woodland being, that being can be summoned at double the normal range. If this is done, no other woodland creatures are affected.

If the saving throw is failed, the spell takes effect at the next sunrise or sunset (whichever comes first). From the time the spell takes effect until the spell is negated, the sleeping pattern of the victim is randomly disrupted. At sunset and sunrise of every day, a check is made to determine the effects of chaotic sleep. In the 12-hour period that follows the check, there is an equal chance that the character will be unable to sleep or unable to remain awake (roll 1d6; on a roll of 1-3, the character is awake, on a roll of 4-6, he sleeps). This condition lasts until the next sunrise (or sunset) when the check is made again. For example, a fighter fails to save against chaotic sleep. For the next few hours, the spell has no effect. At sundown, the first check is made, resulting in a 2. The fighter does not notice anything until he tries to sleep that night, at which time he is wide awake, fidgeting and restless. At sunrise, another die roll is made, resulting in a 6. The fighter is suddenly exhausted and sleeps until sunset. Characters who sleep as a result of this spell can be roused only by physical stimuli--a slap or a wound, for example. Once awake, the character remains conscious only as long as there are active stimuli around him, such as a fight. Walking through caves or riding a horse will not keep the character awake. Unlike a sleep spell, characters affected by chaotic sleep doze off as soon as they are left relatively undisturbed. Keeping an affected character awake is difficult at best. Lack of sleep will eventually take a physical toll on any character under the influence of the spell. For every 12-hour period that a character remains awake beyond the first, he suffers a -1 penalty to THAC0. Such characters do not regain hit points as a result of normal healing. Spellcasters cannot memorize spells until they have had sufficient sleep. Chaotic sleep can be removed with a remove curse. The material components are a pinch of sand and three coffee beans."

The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, although it only affects one creature of 4 or more Hit Dice or levels, regardless of the number rolled. All possible subjects receive saving throws vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any damage inflicted by the caster or his allies in the round of casting grants the wounded creature another saving throw at a bonus of +1 per point of damage received.  Any affected creature regards the spellcaster as friendly, an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm.  If communication is possible, the charmed creature follows reasonable requests, instructions, or orders most faithfully (see the suggestion spell).  If communication is not possible, the creature does not harm the caster, but others in the vicinity may be subject to its intentions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at the very least allows a new saving throw against the charm.  Affected creatures eventually come out from under the influence of the spell. This is a function of the creature's level (i.e., its Hit Dice). 1st level or up to 2 Hit Dice Monsters have a 5% chance per week of breaking the spell. 2nd level or up to 3+2 Hit Dice Monsters have a 10% chance per week of breaking the spell. 3rd level or up to 4+4 Hit Dice Monsters have a 15% chance per week of breaking the spell. 4th level or up to 6 Hit Dice Monsters have a 25% chance per week of breaking the spell. 6th level or up to 7+2 Hit Dice Monsters have a 35% chance per week of breaking the spell. 6th level or up to 8+4 Hit Dice Monsters have a 45% chance per week of breaking the spell. 7th level or up to 10 Hit Dice Monsters have a 60% chance per week of breaking the spell. 8th level or up to 12 Hit Dice Monsters have a 75% chance per week of breaking the spell. 9th level or over 12 Hit Dice Monsters have a 90% chance per week of breaking the spell.

If he discovers treasure, he divides it into tidy piles or containers of silver, gold, and copper. He is reluctant to enter a dungeon because it is a messy place, but once inside, he is obsessed with cleaning it. A character under the power of this spell will sweep dirt from dungeon corridors into neat piles, arrange the corpses of a defeated orc band according to size, dash forward to remove a bit of lint on clothing, and insist that the party organize themselves alphabetically, then by size, and then by age. While the spell does not affect a character's abilities, the overwhelming desire for order impairs the character's usefulness in most adventures. When a character afflicted by this spell attempts to undertake a new event (begin a battle, haggle with the merchant, etc.), the player must rationalize the action on the basis of his compulsion for order. Thus, the character cannot simply attack a goblin; he must announce a condition such as attacking the tallest goblin and fighting his way down according to size. Once stated, the character must follow through with this plan. If the player cannot conceive a rationale for his character's behavior, the character is forced to delay his actions for 1d6 rounds, with the time spent in preparation for the subsequent action. The character spends time arranging spell components artistically, deciding how to hold his sword, cleaning his weapon, etc. Anyone affected by compulsive order may become violent if he is prevented from being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly. If he is allowed to organize his surroundings, he will quickly calm down again. The victim will constantly petition the people around him to be neat and organized. The victim is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell. Compulsive order can be removed with a dispel magic spell. The material component is a perfect cube made of metal."

The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level.  These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10): 1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again) 7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) 10 Act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts for two rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the 'wander away for the duration of the spell' result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four attack, and one acts normally.

The priest may affect one creature per two levels of his experience, and all creatures to be affected must be within three feet of each other at the time of casting. After the spell is completed, affected characters may move about freely. Defensive harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enhanced coordination of their attacks and defenses. The affected creatures must be involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved. For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class. This bonus represents a mystical coordination of effort on the part of all affected creatures. A fighter will naturally wage his attack to distract the troll attacking the thief. The ranger will instinctively block the swing of an orc, thereby protecting the wizard. Creatures affected by the spell are not consciously aware of these efforts, and they are unable to create specific strategies and tactics."

In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit.  If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every five feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after five feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug. Any creature at the edge (within one foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed.  Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported. The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half. To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and must continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items disappear at the conclusion of the spell."

The chest is unlocked and any items that can fit inside may be placed in there. Once the caster has placed what they want in the chest, they can close the lid and remove the key. Once the key is removed, the chest vanishes into a small dimensional pocket where it is untouchable by any but extreme means. The key remains on the same plane as the caster. This key, when placed in any lock by any creature, will summon the chest at the feet (or nearby flat surface) of its holder, and the key will dissolve. The chest will fizzle after 5 minutes unless the Dimensional Chest spell is cast again, in which case the same chest can be sent back without having to move items between chests. A fizzled chest dumps its contents where the chest was resting. The chest will say in extra dimensional space until recalled. Should a wizard lockup their goods and then be eaten by a large creature, it may be many years or centuries until someone finds the key again, but the chest will still be waiting. The extra dimensional chest space is only as large as the chest and the only air there is what is in the chest. Living creatures should not be put in the chest if they wish to survive.

		"description": "This spell allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into higher dimensions. This effect can be best explained through an example. If an ant crawling along the west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl the full width of the map. But if the map were folded in two so that the east and west edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all. The ant's world (the map) would have been folded through the third dimension. The dimensional folding spell does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same plane of existence. Although this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell teleport, in practice, it is much different. The dimensional folding spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous, bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane. This gate is circular, of any size up to 10' in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round. The caster and any other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open. Missile weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate. The gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to starshine. Vision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing the priest to 'look before he leaps.' However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able to see the priest and his point of origin. The 'near side' of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest. The location of the 'far side' of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires. Thus, there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell teleport. There is a risk involved in using dimensional folding, however. Many philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this spell seems to support this thesis. Unless the priest is extremely familiar with the destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a dimensional folding gate will suffer instantaneous aging. Theorists believe that this is the same kind of 'slippage' that can cause a teleporting wizard to land high or low, except that in this case, the slippage is in the time dimension. The chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest is with the destination. The table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging. Chance of Amount of Destination is: aging aging Very familiar* 2% 1 year Studied carefully 5% 1d2 years Seen casually 10% 1d3 years Viewed once 15% 1d6 years Never seen 25% 1d10 years * Use this row if the desired location is within view of the priest. If the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate in either direction suffers the aging effect. Multiple creatures passing through the gate in the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll. Although the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time. Although the word 'destination' is used to refer to the 'far end' of the gate, the priest need not be the one doing the traveling. For example, a priest may open the gate near a distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest. The material component is a sheet of platinum 'tissue' worth at least 15 gp, which the priest folds intricately during the casting. The tissue is consumed when the gate closes."

The target area requires 1 turn of ritualistic preparation but this spell has a casting time of 1 in a prepared area. The material components include the set and setting of the area, which must by consistent with the targeted plane. Multiple Tears cast subsequently can allow access to more distant planes. The portal is approximately the caster's height, and any creature or object may travel through it. Typically a tear will reseal and close in 3-100 minutes, but on a roll of 99 or 100 on the duration, there is a persistent weakening of the inter-planar boundary. This spell needs an appropriate area to be cast. To enter the Feywild one might need a zone of standing stones, a specially created henge, or a special tree imbued with the soul a denizen of the Feywild. "

		"description": "A divination spell is used to garner a useful piece of advice concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that will occur within a one-week period. This can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury spell, this gives a specific piece of advice. For example, if the question is 'Will we do well if we venture to the third level?' and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight), the divination response might be: 'Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.' In all cases, the DM controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll might move away and take the treasure with it). The base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. The material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and the holy symbol of the priest. If an unusually important divination is attempted, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, jewelry, or magical items may be required."

Like fortify, entrench may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field or grassland, or a rough outdoors area such as a hillside or forest. Large rooms or chambers may be entrenched as well. In addition to the ditches and ramparts of the fortify spell, entrench makes use of local materials to create a small palisade and an array of stakes or sharp stones to discourage attackers. A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth faced by a staked ditch rises from the ground along the perimeter of the site. Creatures defending the dike receive 75% cover against missile fire (+7 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the rampart, and must spend one full round negotiating the defenses in order to attack. The dike's defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls against any creatures trying to move through the stakes or stones. B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones, deadwood, and briars are arranged to form a defensible wall along the perimeter of the area of effect, faced by an array of sharp stakes or stones. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 90% cover (+10 bonus to AC), or 50% cover (+4 bonus) if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. Attacking creatures cannot run, charge, or sprint through the defenses, and must spend one full round to get through the stakes plus an additional round climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. The wall's defenders gain a +1 bonus to attacks against creatures negotiating the defenses. C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In swamps or bogs, entrench creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 15 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet deep; most creatures require two full rounds to negotiate the ditch and climb up the far side, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side. The fortifications created by this spell are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and clearing or filling can return the site to its original state. The material component is the shell of a giant nautilus. In the Battlesystem rules, entrench provides the defending units with a +3 bonus to their AR versus missile and melee attacks, but only a +1 bonus against missile attacks in marshy areas."

There are ld4 such tentacles, plus one per experience level of the spellcaster. Any creature within range of the writhing tentacles is subject to attack as determined by the DM. The target of a tentacle attack must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds, the subject suffers 1d4 points of damage from contact with the tentacle, and then the tentacle is destroyed. Failure to save indicates that the damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon member is wrapped around its subject and damage will be 3d4 points on the second and succeeding rounds.  Since these tentacles have no intelligence to guide them, there is the possibility that they entwine any object - a tree, post, pillar, even the wizard himself - or continue to squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold established by a tentacle remains until the tentacle is destroyed by some form of attack or until it disappears at the end of the spell's duration.

Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of flame around it must successfully roll a saving throw vs. spell or be charmed into remaining motionless and gazing, transfixed, at the flames.

The fire charm is broken if the charmed creature is physically attacked, if a solid object comes between the creature and the veil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or when the duration of the spell expires. Those exposed to the fire charm again may be affected at the DMs option, although bonuses may also be allowed to the saving throws.

When casting this spell, the wizard appears to immolate himself, but the flames are thin and wispy, shedding no heat, though giving light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch. The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color) - blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each shield are as follows: A) Warmshield. The flames are warm to the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against fire-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage. The material component for this variation is a bit of phosphorus. B) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against cold-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage. The material component for this variation is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail portions of four dead ones. Any creature striking the spellcaster with its body or hand-held weapons inflicts normal damage upon the wizard, but the attacker suffers the same amount of damage.

		"description": "This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy. This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy. The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus immediately fails. Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival. Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living. Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible. Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical. The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion. Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell. The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects. Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions. The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely. Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3. Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10' radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast. Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored. The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails. The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter. The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast."

Fortify automatically causes the cure spell to function at maximum effect.

Running creatures trip and fall, those reaching for an item drop it, those employing weapons likewise awkwardly drop them, etc.  Recovery from a fall or to pick up a fumbled object typically requires a successful saving throw and takes one round. Note that breakable items might suffer damage when dropped. A subject succeeding with his saving throw can act freely that round, but if he is in the area at the beginning of the next round, another saving throw is required.  Alternatively, the spell can be cast at an individual creature. Failure to save means the creature is affected for the spell's entire duration; success means the creature is slowed (see the 3rd-level spell). The material component of this spell is a dab of solidified milk fat. "

Speculation about the future, such as 'What's on the other side of the door?' is not permitted. As with idea, the DM must be careful in adjudicating this spell. The answer to the question should always be relevant and correct, although not necessarily complete, and should not be unbalancing to the situation. The answer can also be cryptic, in the form of a riddle or rhyme, depending on the DM's assessment of the situation.

		"description": "By means of this spell, the priest can turn one or more normal-sized insects into larger forms resembling the giant insects described in the Monstrous Manual. Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level: Priest's Insect Maximum Level Hit Dice Total HD 7-9 3 9 10-12 4 12 13+ 6 15 For example, an 8th-level priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die). If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above. If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die. For example, a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage. Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands ('attack,' 'defend,' 'guard,' and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them. The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insectlike creatures. The priest must use his holy symbol for either version of the spell."

All other creatures believe it is there, and movement and order of march are affected accordingly. Touching the illusory growth neither affects the magic nor reveals its nature. The hallucinatory forest remains until it is magically dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a dispel magic spell.

A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to look like a wide and smooth road.  The hallucinatory terrain persists until a dispel magic spell is cast upon the area or until the duration expires. Individual creatures may see through the illusion, but the illusion persists, affecting others who observe the scene. If the illusion involves only a subtle change, such as causing an open wood to appear thick and dark, or increasing the slope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed even by those in the midst of it. If the change is extreme, a grassy plain covering a seething field of volcanic mudpots, for instance, the illusion will no doubt be noticed the instant one person falls prey to it.  Each level of experience expands the dimensions of the area affected, e.g., a 12th-level caster affects a 120yd. x 120yd. x 120yd. area.

The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being wizard locked and the latter being secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow flue.

The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the lesser geas, but suffers a -2 penalty on its save if the wizard is of higher level or Hit Dice, or a -4 penalty if the wizard is more than twice the victim’s level or Hit Dice. The wizard must be careful in the wording of his lesser geas since the casting and fulfillment are tricky. The subject should be given a tangible, achievable goal, with clear courses of action available to him. 'Climb that mountain!' or 'Tear that mountain down rock by rock!' are legitimate geases, but a geas such as 'Become a mountain!' is just not specific enough to work. Similar to the 6th-level spell geas, the lesser geas compels the subject to obey the wizard's command. If the geased creature fails to follow the wizard's instructions, it will grow sick-each week that passes, the creature loses one point from each ability score, 1 hit point per Hit Die, and suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws. These penalties cannot reduce an ability score to less than 3, reduce a creature to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die, or reduce its attacks and saves by more than 4 points. The lesser geas can be countermanded by a remove curse spell, or a limited wish or wish. However, if the subject entertains thoughts of removing the lesser geas, it will protect itself by giving the subject a warning headache. If the subject persists, then the sickness will begin."

The wizard casts the spell, slowly turns, and is able to sense the direction of the person or creature, provided the subject is within range. The wizard learns how far away the creature is and in what direction it is moving (if at all). This spell can locate a general species of creature (a horse or umber hulk, for instance) or can be used to find a specific individual. The wizard must have physically seen the individual or the type of creature at least once from a distance of no more than 10 yards. Unlike locate object, this spell is not blocked by lead.

The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet for every experience level of the priest. The water is lowered within a square area whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16 feet x 80 feet x 80 feet, a 9th-level caster affects a volume up to 18 feet x 90 feet x 90 feet, and so on. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: The creature moves at half speed and makes half its usual number of attacks each round. The spell has no effect on other creatures. Its reverse, raise water, causes water or similar fluids to return to their highest natural level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This can make fords impassable, float grounded ships, and may even sweep away bridges at the DM's option. It negates lower water and vice versa. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol and a pinch of dust."

There are some significant differences between the spells, however. Elves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. Priest and subject need not share a common language. The priest can force the subject into combat, but the subject's attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force the subject to cast spells or use any innate magical or magiclike abilities. The priest can force the subject to speak, although the priest cannot inject a full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said by the subject is in a monotone). This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject. Breaking either of these conditions causes the spell to terminate immediately. This spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While maintaining this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another spell. If the priest is wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell immediately terminates. If the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to perform particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock. At 11th level or higher, however, this restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a thief to pick a lock. Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the 'remote control' nature of the action. The material component is a mesh of fine threads that the priest loops around the fingertips of one hand and manipulates in the way that a puppeteer controls a puppet."

Note that spell effects are not actually disrupted by the globe unless cast directly through or into it: The caster would still see a mirror image created by a wizard outside the globe.

Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing. One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is. Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.

For instance, he could recall every word from a five-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book. 3) Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced. 4) Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.

If the caster's concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, the spell is lost. Modified memory will not  necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if they contradict his natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much e enjoyed drinking poison, will be dismissed by the subject as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modified memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with the caster (inclining the subject to act favorably toward the caster), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that the caster cheated him in a card game.

The victim may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no saving throw.

The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice monster. It is invulnerable to all attacks, and it can pass through any barriers. Once cast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it exists only in the subject's mind. The only defenses against a phantasmal killer are an attempt to disbelieve (which can be tried but once), slaying or rendering unconscious the wizard who cast the spell, or rendering unconscious the target of the spell for its duration.  To disbelieve the killer, the subject must specifically state the attempt and then roll an Intelligence check. This roll has a -1 penalty for every four levels of the caster. Special modifiers apply to this attack: If surprised, the roll is modified -2; If the subject has previously been attack by this spell, the roll is modified +1; If the subject is an illusionist, the roll is modified +2; If the subject is wearing a helm of telepathy, the roll is modified +3; Magic resistance, bonuses against fear, and Wisdom adjustments also apply.  Magic resistance is checked first to determine Spell operation, and then the fear/Wisdom bonus applies as a minus to the dice roll to match or score less than Intelligence. If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve it or be subject to its attack and possible effects. If the subject ignores the killer to perform other actions, such as attacking the caster, the killer may, at the DMs option, gain bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, etc.).

Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability.  The reverse - polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence - results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following). The polymorphed creature acquires the and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.).

As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified. When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it. When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place. A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities. Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well. The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad. The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."

Furthermore, the wizard gains its physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. No system shock roll is required. The spell does not give the new form's other abilities (attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of changing personality and mentality. When the polymorph occurs, the caster's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The caster retains all mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. A caster not used to a new form might be penalized at the DMs option (e.g., -2 penalty to attack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to master it. Thus a wizard changed into an owl could fly, but his vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings, but not the pudding's offensive (acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient to enable normal movement.  The spellcaster can change his form as often as desired for the duration of the spell, each change requiring a round. The wizard retains his own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws. The wizard can end the spell at any time; when voluntarily returning to his own form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12 hit points. The wizard also will return to his own form when slain or when the effect is dispelled, but no hit points are restored in these cases."

		"description": "This spell allows the priest to increase or decrease by a small margin the probability of success for one action. This action can be anything that requires a die roll--an attack, a saving throw, an attempt to use thieving skills, an ability check, or even an attempt to successfully teleport on target. The action must be something performed by a single creature. The basic modification is 15% (15 on 1d100 or 3 on 1d20), plus an additional 5% per five levels of the caster. This modification can be either positive or negative, as deemed by the spellcaster. Thus, a 10th-level priest can modify a subject's saving throw or attack roll by +5 or -5, or a thief's 'climb walls' roll by +25% or -25%. The priest may cast this spell on himself. For a noncombat action such as an attempt to climb a wall, the priest simply casts the spell on the subject immediately before the action is attempted, informing the DM whether the modification is positive or negative. To use this spell in combat, the priest must specify the action to be affected (e.g., the target's next attack roll) and whether the modification will be positive or negative. The spell remains in effect until the subject attempts the specified action or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level passes. If the latter occurs, the spell ends without effect. Once the spell is cast, the priest does not need to maintain any level of concentration; the spell will function even if the casting priest is killed before the spell takes effect. The subject of the spell has no way of knowing whether any modification made by this spell is positive or negative (or even whether he was the subject of the spell at all). Thus, a lying priest could claim to raise a thief's chance of climbing the wall, while actually lowering it. The thief would be none the wiser. However, an unwilling subject of this spell receives a normal saving throw to negate its effect. The material components are a small cube of a thickened sugar-and-milk mixture and a cubic die of matching size. Both are consumed in the casting."

The participants can quickly share such personal concepts as plans, hopes, and fears, but they cannot share skills or spells. Thus, it is impossible to communicate the procedure for casting a particular spell or for picking a lock. Communication through rapport is approximately 15 times faster than verbal communication. As with telepathy, the priest can establish separate 'channels' to multiple individuals; each such linkage costs one casting of the spell. There is no 'crosstalk' between the channels, however.

The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort. The actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by 0.2. Any remainder less than 0.4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.) Those viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monsters suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately. Those who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than 0.4 as done with hit points. Example: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit, and the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by 0.2 separately, rounded up or down, then added together to get total damage. Thus if the attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x 0.2 = 0.8 [rounded to 1], 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 [rounded to 1], 11 x 0.2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2].

		"description": "By means of this spell, the priest renders a creature touched immune to the effects of a specified spell of 4th level or lower. It protects against spells, spell-like effects of magical items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against breath weapons or gaze attacks of any type. The spell has several additional limitations. First, the caster must have directly experienced the effect of the specified spell. For example, if the caster has been attacked by a fireball spell at some time, he can use the spell immunity spell to provide protection from a fireball. Second, the spell cannot affect a creature already magically protected by a potion, protective spell, ring, or other device. Third, only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain sphere of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect; thus, a creature given immunity to the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a shocking grasp spell. The material component for spell immunity is the same as that for the spell to be protected against."

		"description": "By means of this spell, the caster can change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experience level, into snakes; thus, a 9th-level priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal number of snakes. These snakes attack as commanded by the priest. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a saving throw equal to that of the possessor (i.e., a spear held by an orc must roll the orc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical items, such as staves and enchanted spears, are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect are changed. The type of snake created varies, but a typical specimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a movement rate of 9, and either constricts for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The chance of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcaster desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a maximum 55% chance that any snake created by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts for two rounds for each experience level of the spellcaster. The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales. The reverse spell changes normal-sized snakes to sticks for the same duration, or it negates the sticks to snakes spell according to the level of the priest countering the spell (for example, a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks)."

This limit applies regardless of attack rolls (hit or miss) and regardless of whether the attack was physical or magical.  For example, a stoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard would protect against from five to eight attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce the protection by three each round; four magic missiles would count as four attacks in addition to inflicting their normal damage. The material components of the spell are granite and 50gp worth diamond dust sprinkled on the recipient's skin."

		"description": "By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of suspended animation. The victim's breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply asleep, not dead. A caster of 7th to 10th level can maintain the suspended animation for up to one week plus one day per level; a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one week per level; and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in suspended animation for one year plus one month per level. This spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions become quiescent during the victim's slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every month that the subject is in suspended animation, he recovers one hit point. The caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell's duration, although he must be in the subject's presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened. If the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his suspended animation. The subject will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion, suffering a -2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round. Some of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes all of the priest's concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the suspended animation. For each week that the subject is in suspended animation, the priest loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the saving throw doesn't succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is attempted. The material component for this spell is a rare herb that must be prepared with exacting care. The treatment costs at least 200 gold pieces and requires 1d3 days of the priest's time and attention."

The spell does not affect individuals or monsters moving and operating alone. (When using the BATTLESYSTEM rules, figures that represent individual heroes are not affected by this spell.)

For the duration of the spell, everyone within 30 yards of the subject senses the subject's thoughts, making it impossible for him to lie, keep secrets, conceal motives, etc. The subject is not automatically aware that his thoughts are being sensed. Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source. This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast. If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position ('Oh no, he's looking right at me,' etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster. The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a 'normal' mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw. The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting. This balloon is consumed in the casting."

Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who benefits from the spell. The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and other variables are all based on the character's temporary level. The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level. As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level. Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests.

The acid can also be neutralized with soda, ash, lye, charcoal, or removed with a large quantity of water. The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. paralyzation or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five caster levels. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage. The material component for this spell is a drop of giant slug bile."

The spell creates either an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-foot square per level of the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up to 10 feet+ 5 feet per two levels of experience of the wizard. In either form, the wall of fire is 20 feet high. The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, upon any creature passing through it.  Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage.  Note that attempting to catch a moving creature with a newly-created wall of fire is difficult; a successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on.  The wall of fire lasts as long as the wizard concentrates on maintaining it, or one round per level of experience of the wizard, in the event he does not wish to concentrate upon it. The material component of the spell is phosphorus."

		"description": "This spell can be cast in one of three ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall upon creatures with the effect of an ice storm. A) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1 inch thick per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.).  Any creature breaking through the ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides. B) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere. C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm's hail stones - 3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice. The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal."

The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 10 feet (a 10th-level caster could affect a 100' x 100' x 100' cube). An area protected by weather stasis is unaffected by temperature variations in the surrounding environment. The spell also acts as a shield against rain, snow, and hail, which cannot enter the protected area. If conditions of precipitation existed in the area of effect when the spell was cast, the identical weather will continue for the duration of the spell. For example, weather stasis is cast in an area where the temperature is 75 F. and no precipitation is falling. Half an hour later, the temperature drops to 60 degrees and rain begins to fall. The protected area remains dry and the temperature stays at 75 degrees. If the spell had been cast while rain was falling in the area of effect, rain would continue to fall for the duration of the spell, even after it stopped raining in the surrounding area. All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass into the protected area. All creatures and characters can move freely into and out of the area. The spell does not prevent water-based spells or water-based creatures (such as water elementals) from operating in the area. The spell protects against both natural and magically generated weather. Night and day pass normally in the protected area, although temperature variations associated with night and day do not occur. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a drop of rain."

If used from a high place such as a mountainside or tower, the caster can glide a maximum horizontal distance of 20 feet per foot of initial altitude-for example, if the priest used this spell and launched himself from a hilltop 800 feet high, he could glide a maximum distance of 16,000 feet, or about 3 miles. If windborne is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to a maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide 10 feet per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would ascend to an altitude of 70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal distance of 700 feet. He can choose to glide for a much shorter distance, but never less than his initial altitude. While gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can choose to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round without risk of a damaging impact upon landing. The caster doesn't gain a mastery of aerial combat with this spell and suffers a -2 penalty to his attack rolls and Armor Class if he becomes involved in combat while gliding.

The wizard eye travels at 30 feet per round if viewing an area ahead as a human would (i.e., primarily looking at the floor), or 10 feet per round if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead.  The wizard eye can see with infravision up to 10 feet, and with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts.  It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (one inch in diameter). Using the eye requires the wizard to concentrate. However, if his concentration is broken, the spell does not end - the eye merely becomes inert until the wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye.  A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell. With respect to blindness, magical darkness, and so on, the wizard eye is considered an independent sensory organ of the caster. The material component of the spell is a bit of bat fur."

As a guideline, each additional 100 years of aging causes an increasingly severe reaction. Thus, after 200 years, parchment might become little more than powder, while iron might begin to flake away at a touch. Many items (especially gems) show little reaction to age. The DM must adjudicate all effects. The material components are a flask of seawater and a piece of coal. The reverse of this spell, youthful object, returns an object ravaged by the effects of time to its original condition; thus, rusty iron becomes strong and shiny, crumbled masonry becomes firm, and rotten wood becomes solid. The age of matter can be reduced by 20 years per level of the caster. The material components for youthful object are a piece of eggshell and a hair from the head of a human or humanoid infant."

The following types of dead creatures can be animated: A) Humans, demihumans, and humanoids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained, or one zombie for every two levels. The experience levels, if any, of the slain are ignored: the body of a newly dead 9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie with 2 Hit Dice, without special class or racial abilities. B) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. The number of undead animated is determined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit Dice cannot exceed the wizards level). Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have one more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard could animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2 + 1 Hit Dice]= 12), or a single fire giant skeleton. Such undead have none of the special abilities they had in life. C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The caster can animate two skeletons per level or one zombie per level. The creatures have their normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an additional Hit Die as zombies, Clerics receive a +1 bonus when trying to turn these.

Characters without bonuses or with combat penalties could conceivably be included in the spell; such characters count against the maximum number of creatures that can be affected. Penalties are likewise applied to the champion; contributors to this spell must be chosen carefully. The bonuses gained through this spell are added to the character's own bonuses (if any). The champion channels the energy of others through himself, improving his fighting ability. The champion must be in the line of sight and within 30 feet of the characters aiding him. Characters who contribute their bonuses must concentrate on the champion for the duration of the spell. If this concentration is broken (by moving more than 10 feet per round, fighting, being struck, or losing sight of the champion), that character's contribution is immediately lost. The spell expires when the last character contributing power to the champion ceases concentration. A champion may benefit from only one champion's strength spell at one time. Contributors can aid only one champion at one time. The material component is a chain of five gold links worth at least 1,000 gp."

The spell causes disorientation and severe perceptual distortion, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level. Those allowed saving throws roll them vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who successfully save are unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures react as follows: On a d10 roll of 1 the affected creatures wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell On a d10 roll of 2-6 the affected creatures stand confused one round (then roll again) On a d10 roll of 7-9 the affected creatures attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) On a d10 roll of 10 the affected creatures act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those affected are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the 'wander away for the duration of the spell' result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible using their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The material component for this spell is a small disc of bronze and a small rod of iron."

The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell, clearing a 10-foot-square ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward. The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky ground, and snow. The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half. This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain. (See Table 74 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if clear path is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case can clear path reduce movement cost below 1. Clear path has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on magically-created terrain or manmade barricades. A priest using the clear path spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required. The material components are a knife blade and a straw from a broom. The reverse, clutter path, causes weeds, small stones, and similar debris to litter a 10- foot path extending 10 feet behind the caster. This hides a trail, making tracking more difficult. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell. The chance to successfully track on a cluttered path is reduced by 50%. The material components are a handful of pebbles and a handful of weeds."

The cloud of purification transmutes organic filth, garbage, and vermin (mice, rats, rot grubs, and so on) into an equal quantity of pure water. For example, a nest of rot grubs caught in the cloud would 'melt,' becoming small puddles of clean water. If the spell is cast over a body of water, the cloud merges with a portion of the water equal to its own size, transmuting any filth, microbes, small fish, or other 'impurities' into clean water. The cloud's vapors are heavier than air, so they sink to the lowest level of the land (even down holes in the ground). Thus, this spell is perfect for cleansing a sewer or well.

The cloudkill moves away from the spellcaster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds.  As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pour down den or sinkhole openings; thus the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example.

The spell will, at best, provide information to aid character decisions. Entities communed with structure their answers to further their own purposes. It is probable that the DM will limit the use of commune spells to one per adventure, one per week, or even one per month, for the greater powers dislike frequent interruptions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses the answers, or goes off to do anything else, the spell immediately ends. The material components necessary for a commune spell are the priest's religious symbol, holy (unholy) water, and incense.

The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental with this spell - assuming he has the material component for the particular elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large amount of water must be available to conjure a water elemental.) Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice. It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type of elemental can be conjured only once per day. The conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard - the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands - or it turns on the wizard and attacks. The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken.  There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell's duration expires.  Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water. The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:   Air Elemental - burning incense   Earth Elemental - soft clay   Fire Elemental - sulphur and phosphorus   Water Elemental - water and sand Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell."

		"description": "This spell allows the priest to determine how one recent event fits into the 'grand scheme.' By casting this spell, the priest can determine whether the sequence or situation that gave rise to the specific event is complete or whether it is ongoing; whether it was a significant or insignificant event in the larger picture; or whether it will continue to have repercussions for the participants. Using his knowledge of circumstances, the DM communicates these facts to the caster's player. This 'arcane message' is normally straightforward and easy to understand, but in the case of highly complex circumstances, the message might be cryptic. In any case, the message will always be truthful. As an example, consider a priest and his party who are on a holy quest to retrieve an item of power. On the way to the location of this item, the party is ambushed by evil creatures from the Inner Planes but manages to defeat them. Concerned that these creatures might be outlying guards protecting the item of interest, the priest casts consequence, hoping for guidance. The DM knows that these creatures have nothing to do with the quest; the encounter was coincidental. However, the surviving monsters will soon be returning with reinforcements to avenge their dead. Therefore, the DM tells the priest's player, 'To your goals these have no place, but still they can cause more woe.' Casting this spell 'taints' subsequent castings of the same spell within a 24-hour span. A second attempt within this period always results in the same message as the first, regardless of the true situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 24 hours of another casting, he receives an accurate reading. The material component is three special coins or dice made of platinum (total value of at least 1,000 gp), which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins or dice are not consumed in the casting."

As these powers resent such contact, only brief answers are given. (The DM answers all questions with 'yes,' 'no,' 'maybe,' 'never,' 'irrelevant,' etc.) Any questions asked are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For every two levels of experience of the wizard, one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the effects. The accompanying random table is subject to DM changes, development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on. If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question is asked. This condition lasts for one week for each removal of the plane contacted (see the DMG or the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set), to a maximum of 10 weeks. There is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies before recovering, unless a remove curse spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question. On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers.

If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer “unknown.” Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane. Optional Rule The DM may allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted--each difference in moral or ethical alignment lowers the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, an 18th-level lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful good plane) on the 'Intelligence 20' line, or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the 'Intelligence 19' line."

Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force. An 'eye' of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."

If the priest's level exceeds the subject's level or Hit Dice, the subject is not allowed a saving throw, but creatures of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. Also note that magic resistance may apply, as well. If used to banish an extraplanar or multidimensional creature, dimensional translocation prevents the creature from returning to the Prime Material Plane for the duration of the spell. The creature may be able to take other actions, such as using magical items or spell-like abilities on itself while it waits to return. If the caster instead forces an extradimensional creature into the Prime Material Plane, one or more of the following effects may apply, at the DM's option: The creature's Armor Class may be reduced by 1d6 points for the duration of the spell. The quality of a magical weapon needed to strike the creature may be reduced by one 'plus'; for example, a monster normally hit by +2 or better weapons may become vulnerable to +1 weapons for the spell's duration. The creature may suffer permanent death upon the loss of all its hit points. Use of 1d6 spell-like powers (such as gating in allies) may be limited or negated. Undead creatures lose the ability to drain life energy levels.

Disguise cannot change the size category of the unit's members. Thus, a unit of humans may appear to be a unit of elves, but may not appear as a unit of giants or halflings.

If the wizard's level is higher, the difference is subtracted from the creature's die roll for its saving throw vs. spell. If the creature's level or Hit Dice is higher, the difference is added to the saving throw roll. If the creature desires to be returned to its home plane, no saving throw is necessary (it chooses to fail the roll). If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but the spell has a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own. The material component is any item that is distasteful to the subject creature."

		"description": "The priest using this spell causes a summoned creature of evil nature, an evil creature from another plane, or a creature summoned by an evil caster, to return to its own plane or place when the caster successfully strikes it in melee combat. Examples of such creatures are aerial servants, djinn, efreet, elementals, and invisible stalkers. An evil enchantment (such as a charm spell cast by an evil creature) that is subject to a normal dispel magic spell can be automatically dispelled by the dispel evil spell. This spell lasts for a maximum of one round for each experience level of the caster, or until expended. While the spell is in effect, all creatures that could be affected by it fight with a -7 penalty to their attack rolls when engaging the spellcaster. The reverse of the spell, dispel good, functions against summoned or enchanted creatures of good alignment or creatures that have been sent to aid the cause of good. The material components for this spell are the priest's religious object and holy (or unholy) water."

The wizard must also cast a conjure elemental spell to summon an earth elemental. The elemental serves without attempting to break free when the spellcaster announces that his intent is to cast a distance distortion spell. The spell places the earth elemental in the area of effect, and the elemental then causes the area's dimensions to be either doubled or halved for those traveling over it (spellcaster's choice). Thus, a 10-foot x 100-foot corridor could seem to be either 5 feet wide and 50 feet long or 20 feet wide and 200 feet long. When the spell duration has elapsed, the elemental returns to its own plane. The true nature of an area affected by distance distortion is undetectable to any creature traveling along it, but the area dimly radiates magic, and a true seeing spell can reveal that an earth elemental is spread within the area. The material needed for this spell is a small lump of soft clay."

Elves and halfelves resist this enchantment as they do all charm-type spells. When the spell is cast, the subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell at a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjustments apply. Failure means the wizard has established a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common language is shared, the wizard can generally force the subject to perform as the wizard desires, within the limits of the subject's body structure and Strength. Note that the caster does not receive direct sensory input from the subject. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, there is no limit to the range at which it can be exercised, as long as the caster and subject are on the same plane. A protection from evil spell can prevent the caster from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it cannot prevent the establishment of domination."

		"description": "The dream spell enables the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity. As the caster completes the spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The sender then enters the recipient's dream and delivers the message unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned through this spell. The sender is unaware of his own surroundings or the activities around him while he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, both physically and mentally (i.e., he always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. Once the recipient's dreams are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message. The reverse of this spell, nightmare, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day. A dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns the caster of the nightmare for one turn per level of the cleric countering this evil sending."

		"description": "By means of this spell, the wizard splits the reality of an object. While retaining the same basic form, the object is divided into two entities, each of half the mass of the original. Both objects are one and the same, only existing in both places, half way, at the same time. What one experiences, so does the other - but that experience is relative only to the object. For example, a tablet with soft clay inlaid could be written on and the text would appear on the other in real time; however; a tablet turned upside down, lifted, thrown, moved, or otherwise translated does not affect the positioning, rotation, or velocity of the other. A sword thusly split could be wielded in battle by two different people without problem. However, this split existence is extremely fragile. While each object is the same size as the whole form, it only contains half the mass, an thus has half the strength, durability, and weight. A sword split by this spell would be fragile and of little value in combat. Any blow to the subject must roll its enchanter's level or less on a d20 or the item breaks the spell. Any damage, mutation, or phase change to the item breaks the spell. Blinking, teleporting, plane shifting, crossing extradimensional boundaries, or being effected by any number of spells breaks the spell. Such spells include, but are not limited to: Haste, enlarge, magic mouth, dispel magic, and any successful attack spell. When the spell is broken the object fully materializes in one place and vanishes from the other. If the object realizes in the place where the action that broke the spell exists, the object suffers the normal effects it would there. A clay tablet made duo and struck with a sword has an equal chance of realizing either in the path of the sword, or in its other place - potentially being destroyed in the first case and presumably safe in the second. And Identify or Locate Beacon spell may reveal the location of the other reality when cast on an item split by this spell. For Identify, treat the location of the object as a property to be checked for. For Locate Beacon, an intelligence check is needed. This check can be made once per level."

		"description": "This spell allows the priest to alter the characteristics of certain extradimensional spaces such as those created by rope trick and similar spells or those contained in items like bags of holding or portable holes. Extradimensional manipulation can increase or reduce the size of a single extradimensional space. The amount of increase or decrease depends on the level of the caster: Level Multiplier Up to 10 x2 11 to 16 x3 17 or above x4 This means that a 10th-level priest can double the capacity of a bag of holding or decrease it to half its normal size. A 15th-level priest can triple the capacity or reduce it to one-third capacity. If the size and capacity of an extradimensional space is decreased, any contents of the space that exceed the current capacity are expelled (determined randomly). These contents are expelled from the space in the same way they originally entered it, if that path is still open. If the path is closed, as it would be if a bag of holding were tied shut or a portable hole were folded up, the 'extra' contents are expelled into the Astral plane. Any items in an enlarged space when the spell duration expires suffer the same fate. Placing an extradimensional space inside another such space, such as placing a bag of holding inside a portable hole (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), is a dangerous undertaking. Extradimensional manipulation may be cast for the purpose of removing this danger. When used in this manner, the size of the space cannot be affected. However, while this version is in effect, the affected extradimensional space can be placed within another such space (or another extradimensional space may be placed within the affected space) with no adverse consequences. If one space is within the other when the spell expires, the usual consequences ensue immediately. If the space to be affected is being maintained by a spellcaster, as in the case of a rope trick, that spellcaster receives a saving throw to resist the manipulation. If the space is created by a magical item, however, no saving throw is allowed. The material component is a strip of gold tissue worth at least 5 gp that is twisted into a Moebius strip. The strip is consumed in the casting."

The container always weighs a fixed amount, regardless of what is put inside.

The victim will heed only the person designated by the caster. Before the victim undertakes any action, he must gain permission. He will not follow through with an action until he gains permission. If permission is denied, the victim cannot act until he thinks of an alternate action and gains permission for that action.

		"description": "Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the 3rd-level alteration spell blink, allowing the wizard to shift his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location. Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses - but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach. If the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won’t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks. A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9. In the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter’s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions. Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up)."

		"description": "When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. In an environment free of normal insects, the spell fails. The insects obscure vision, limiting it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a random direction until they are more than 240 yards away from the insects. Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must check morale; failure means they run as described above. Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example, a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines, but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for one round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for each level of the caster, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area that centers around a summoning point determined by the spellcaster. The point can be up to 120 yards away from the priest. The insect plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by a dispel magic spell. The material components of this spell are a few granules of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat."

		"description": "This spell allows the caster to more easily access rare or dangerous spell components. The wizard casts this spell upon a silver mirror while concentrating on a mental image of the material he desires. The base chance of success is 50%, modified by the following factors: +1% per level of the caster +10% if the caster has seen the same type of substance or object before; this bonus is not cumulative with the following bonus +20% if the caster has a sample of the material or the same type of object in his possession; this bonus is not cumulative with the bonus above +30% if the wizard knows the location of the desired object -50% if the caster has never seen the same type of material or item before If the percentile roll indicates failure, the caster is unable to locate the desired ingredient and the spell ends. If the roll indicates success, the wizard has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet. The gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate. The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it. The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used. The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment. The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used again, but the powdered opal is consumed in the casting."

		"description": "This devious spell distracts the subject creatures by drawing them into an absorbing discussion on topics of interest to them. A chain of responses occurs during the next 11 rounds, with additional saving throws as described later. These responses are conversation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion (rounds 4-6), and then either rage or lamentation (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are affected by the creatures' Intelligences, as noted later. The subject creatures must be able to understand the language in which the spellcaster speaks. Upon casting the spell, the wizard begins discussion of some topic germane to the creature or creatures to be affected. Those making a successful saving throw vs. spell are unaffected. Affected creatures immediately begin to converse with the spellcaster, agreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As long as the spellcaster chooses, he can maintain the spell by conversing with the subject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise distracted, the subject creatures do not notice. The wizard can leave at any time after the casting and the subject(s) continue on as if the caster were still present. As long as they are not attacked, the creatures ignore all else going on around them, spending their time talking and arguing to the exclusion of other activities. However, when the caster leaves, each subject completes only the stage of the spell that it is currently in, and then the spell is broken. If the caster maintains the spell for more than three rounds, each affected creature can roll another saving throw vs. spell. Those failing to save wander off in confusion for 1d10+2 rounds, staying away from the spellcaster. Those who make this saving throw continue to talk and roll saving throws for each round that the caster continues the spell, up through the sixth round, to avoid the confusion effect. If the spell is maintained for more than six rounds, each subject must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a rage, attacking all other subjects of the spell with intent to kill. This rage lasts for 1d4+1 rounds. Those who successfully save against the rage effect realize that they have been deceived and collapse to the ground, lamenting their foolishness, for 1d4 rounds unless attacked or otherwise disturbed."

		"description": "This spell enables a specially constructed chest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal Plane, to be summoned using a small model of the chest. The large chest must be exceptionally well-crafted and expensive, constructed for the caster by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time--even wish spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest. While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might be mounted to find it. While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!). Whenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn through. If the large chest is not retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost."

		"description": "The magic jar spell enables the caster to shift his life force into a special receptacle (a gem or large crystal). From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions. While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-footper- level radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy. For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked. An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protection from evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard (Intelligence and Hit Dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll. (See book for table). A negative score indicates that the wizard has a lower total than the target; thus, the host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard's life force in the magic jar. If successful, the caster's life force occupies the host body and the host's life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force. The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-foot-per-level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body. A successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends. If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell. If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster's life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain."

Spells that are to be stored in the staff must be memorized normally by the wizard. The spells are then cast as normal when charging the staff; casting requires the spell's normal casting time plus one round. The spell is wiped from memory and material components are consumed. All spells to be stored must be cast into the staff within 1 turn. All stored spells have a casting time of 1. Spells remain in the staff until cast or dispelled, or up to 1 hour per level of the caster. After this time, all stored spells fade away. Only wizards who know the magic staff spell can cast spells from another wizard's staff. This applies to wizards who have never learned or could not normally cast the spells stored in a staff. It is common, however, for the staff's owner to implement a command word which must be known by anyone wishing to use the staff. The material component for this spell is a staff cut from an ash tree. For each spell level the wizard intends to imbue into the staff, it must be inlaid with rubies worth at least 1000gp."

Then chunks of silver, costing 100gp per 1ft diameter of the circle, must be placed at points along the circle. Upon completion of casting the spell the silver melts to form the in-laid silver circle. When casting the spell in this way the wizard must designate a keyword to act as this circles name. The second use of the spell allows the contents of the current circle to switch with the contents of any of the other circles for which the wizard knows the keyword. If a circle is broken by anything at the time of casting the contents of that circle are teleported to a random location. It is imperative the wizard ensures his circle is unbroken before casting.

		"description": "This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete. For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection. When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body. The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm. The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends. Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death. The material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any reason)."

		"description": "This nasty spell 'disconnects' the subject's short-term and long-term memory. While the spell is in effect, the subject is incapable of storing information in long-term memory. Every moment is virtually an independent event for the subject; he or she can remember recent events, thoughts, and sensations for no more than a few seconds (the amount of time they remain in short-term memory). Memories of events that happened before the onset of the spell are not affected at all; these are safely stored in long-term memory. This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below. The subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in shortterm memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits. If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass. Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard. The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building. When the spell expires, the subject remembers nothing that happened while the spell was in effect, possibly leading to amusing consequences ('By the gods, how did I get here?'). The material component is a ruby of at least 200 gp value, which is crushed during the casting."

		"description": "This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell. Schizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's 'not in the mood for magic' at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal. Dementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless. Delusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist. Paranoia: The subject is convinced that 'they' (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence. Hallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc. When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject. While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit. The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total. The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows. Int+Wis Time Between Checks 8 or less 1 month 9 to 18 3 weeks 19 to 24 2 weeks 25 to 30 1 week 31 to 35 3 days 36 or more 1 day The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose. The material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3' in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting."

The light is exactly the same as moonlight, so that colors other than shades of black, gray, or white are vague. The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective way to spotlight something, an opponent, for example. While the moonbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a creature centered in a moonbeam is most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect, but it does not shed a telltale glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision. The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has, in addition, all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change (of a creature in the beam), unless the DM rules otherwise.

The phantom watchdog immediately commences a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the faithful hound is able to detect invisible creatures and ward against the approach of ethereal creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does not react to illusions that are not at least quasi-real. If the intruding creature exposes its back to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, striking for 3d6 points of damage. It is able to hit opponents of all types, even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs (for example, ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour per caster level, but once it is activated by an intruder, it lasts only one round per caster level. If the spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards distant from the area that the watchdog guards, the spell ends.

		"description": "When a priest enters othertime, he steps into a different reality in which the world around him is frozen at a moment in the future. Until time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point. The duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher. The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast othertime. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means. While the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening events. In the example above, if the caster's friends were teleported away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his 'friends,' frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime. This also means that nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him-he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him. As noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the othertime. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a -4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike. Leaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament. Once a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells. After all, if the priest is going to attract his deity's attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out! The material component for this spell is an hourglass filled with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces."

If there is no source of water or even enough humidity to support this spell, then the DM can rule that the spell has no effect. The caster affects a cubic area of 1 foot per level to a side, so a 12th-level caster affects a 12-foot by 12-foot by 12-foot cube (up to a maximum of 25 feet to a side). This can have several effects; first of all, any creature caught in the area of effect when the temperature is lowered suffers 2d4 damage plus 1 point per level of the caster (or 2d4+12, for the 12th-level caster described above), or half that damage with a successful saving throw vs. spell. Any fires in the area are suppressed and may (50% chance) be extinguished. Creatures entering the area of effect after the initial creation of ice suffer no additional damage, although the air will be noticeably dry and cold. However, the ice formed by the spell coats all surfaces and may cause creatures to slip and fall. Any creature moving into or out of the affected area must make a saving throw vs. spell or fall, losing their action for the round. The ice lasts at least 2 rounds per caster level, and then begins to melt at whatever rate nature decrees. If cast on a body of water, this spell creates an iceberg of the stated dimensions. A swimmer or aquatic creature could be caught in the ice and trapped until the ice melts; most air-breathers will suffocate from this treatment, but a few aquatic creatures (fish, amphibians, etc.) may survive being frozen, at the DM's discretion.

		"description": "The renowned fire wizard Daltim developed this spell some years ago to protect important items or structures against the various incendiary spells with which he was familiar. Proofing renders an inanimate object nearly impervious to fire, granting the affected item a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. magical fire (including a dragon's breath), and a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. normal fire. This is cumulative with the saving throw bonus of a magical item, so a cloak of protection +4 could have a bonus of +7 to +10 on any item saving throws versus combustion effects. Remember that an item fails its saving throw on a natural roll of 1, regardless of any bonuses. The item affected must be one discrete construction or object, although it can be articulated or composed of several parts (for example, a suit of armor, a catapult, a house, or a carriage). At 9th level, the wizard can proof an article of clothing or a small piece of furniture; at 12th level, a small vehicle or large piece of furniture; at 15th level, a small building or large vehicle; at 18th level, a medium building or a very large vehicle; and at 20th level or higher, a large building or small fortification. A character dressed in a completely proofed article of clothing (a large cloak) gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire. The material component for proofing versus combustion is a fire-brick made with the ashes left from a phoenix’s fire. Seafaring wizards often use this spell to protect their vessels from hostile fireballs and various fire-throwing devices."

		"description": "This spell conjures a small horde of semi-tangible magical orbs or eyes that can be used to reconnoiter an area at the wizard's command. Each of the eyes is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet(normal vision only) in all  direction. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the caster's hand to replay in the caster's mind everything they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard's ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would-abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes' vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images. The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 16, flies by levitation at a rate of 12,and has only 1 hit point - a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful dispel magic destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it's very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself. When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instruction or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be know by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, 'Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,' or 'Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.' Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger the eye's return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard's link with the eye is such that he won't know if eye was destroyed or if just wandered out of range.   Some command words can be used to abbreviate the direction. For example, 'surround me' directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. 'Spread out' directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard's directions. The material component is a handful of crystal marbles."

The quest can, for example, require that the creature locate and return some important or valuable object, rescue a notable person, release some creature, capture a stronghold, slay a person, deliver some item, and so forth. If the quest is not properly followed, due to disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving throw rolls for each day of such action. This penalty is not removed until the quest is properly pursued or the priest cancels it. There are certain circumstances that will temporarily suspend a quest, and others that will discharge or cancel it. The DM will give you appropriate information as the need to know arises. If cast upon an unwilling subject, the victim is allowed a saving throw. However, if the person quested agrees to a task--even if the agreement is gained by force or trickery--no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just and deserved, a creature of the priest's religion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the priest's alignment saves with a -4 penalty to the saving throw. A quest cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell, as can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or undeserved quest grants bonuses to saving throws, or might even automatically fail.

It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for nonproficiency. It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows: Red --fire dwellers/users and fire elementals Orange --creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and earth elementals Yellow --vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants, etc.) Green --aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals Indigo --acid-using or poison-using creatures Violet --metallic or regenerating creatures When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears. Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster. The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow.

The length of time that the person has been dead is of importance, as the priest can raise persons dead only up to a limit of one day for each experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-level priest can raise a person who has been dead for up to nine days). Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and disease, are not negated. The raised person must roll a successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution. Further, the raised person is weak and helpless, needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic. A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of times he can be revived by this means. The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger.

If the victim of the arrow moves out of range, the subject will fire his second arrow in the direction of the recipient. If the recipient is out of sight, the subject will fire in the direction of the recipient's original location. The subject of a repeat action spell must be capable of performing the indicated action a second time. If a character has no arrows in his quiver, he cannot fire an arrow. If a wizard were ordered to repeat a spell, he would attempt the spell only if he had the spell memorized and had sufficient material components.

Magical arms or armor may apply their bonus to this save, so a sword +3 would gain a +3 to its roll. Other magical metal items may receive a +1 to a +6 bonus based on the DM"

This includes damage from a fireball cast in an area too small for its effects, a reflected lightning bolt, or any other offensive area spell that overlaps the safeguarding's area of effect. The protection is effective against spells of 7th level and lower. The protection does not apply to damage from spells rebounded by any form of magical spell turning. This spell does not protect the wizard against damage from spells or attacks cast by enemies or other party members. A wizard who has cast safeguarding is free to move and act normally. The spell's effect is always centered on him, regardless of his actions. Other creatures are free to enter and exit the area of effect. An area spell cast by the wizard will take effect normally, but its effects will be negated within the area of the safeguarding spell. This applies only to area spells centered outside the radius of the safeguarding spell. If the wizard casts an offensive area spell within the area of the safeguarding, the safeguarding is immediately negated and those within the area suffer full damage from the spell. The wizard is free to cast non-offensive area spells and individually targeted spells within the area of the safeguarding.

The spell lasts two rounds, plus one round per caster level. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object moved beyond the caster's range falls or stops. If the caster ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. The object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. The caster might even be able to untie simple knots, at the discretion of the DM. Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. The caster can hurl one or more objects within range, and within a 10-foot cube, directly away from himself at high speed, to a distance of up to 10 feet per caster level. This is subject to a maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster level. Damage caused by hurled objects is decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 point of damage per caster level. Opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. Furthermore, those able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for example (thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell limit), can easily counter the spell.

The spellcaster is able to teleport a maximum weight of 250 pounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for each level of experience above the 10th (a 13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 pounds). If the destination area is very familiar to the wizard (he has a clear mental picture due to previous proximity to and study of the area), it is unlikely that there is any error in arriving, although the caster has no control over his facing upon arrival. Lesser known areas (those seen only magically or from a distance) increase the probability of error. Unfamiliar areas present considerable peril (see table). Teleporting high means the wizard arrives 10 feet above the ground for every 1% he is below the lowest 'On Target' probability; this could be as high as 320 feet if the destination area was never seen. Any low result means the instant death of the wizard if the area into which he teleports is solid. A wizard cannot teleport to an area of empty space--a substantial surface must be there, whether a wooden floor, a stone floor, natural ground, etc. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible."

		"description": "When this spell is cast, a thin beam of destructive blue force springs forth from the caster's fingertip and strikes any one object within range. The beam imparts an immense amount of energy to the object struck, causing it to spontaneously explode. Large, massive objects have more potential destructive energy than small, lightweight objects, but the wizard must hold the beam on the larger object for a longer time in order to cause detonation. The beam has two principal effects: First of all, the object struck is disintegrated if it fails its item saving throw. Secondly, any creature near the destroyed item suffers damage proportional to the weight of the item detonated, plus blast damage of 1d6 points per two caster levels. Creatures caught within the blast radius may attempt a saving throw vs. paralyzation for half damage (1 point per caster level), but the base damage of the explosion may not be saved against.

Objects more massive than 2000 pounds are simply too big to detonate. Living flesh and enchanted objects or items are immune to the destructive resonance, but a wizard could choose to use Tenser's destructive resonance on an objects worn or carried by another creature. However, if he does so, the victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to negate the beam entirely and prevent any damage at all, and then gains a save for half damage against the blast effect even if the beam succeeds in detonating his equipment.

		"description": "This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests. Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc. The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target 'fellow priests,' 'superiors,' 'adventuring companions,' 'knights of Lord Harcourt,' or 'villagers of Dopp.' If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse. There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster. Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack. The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting. Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest."

While within the area of effect of this spell, the priest (and only the priest) gains several special abilities:  His sense of sight is magically enhanced. He can see through normal darkness and can see invisible creatures and objects. He cannot see through solid objects, however, and the range of his magical sight is limited to 60 feet. The priest has no need for food, water, or rest. He does not feel fatigue and regenerates 1 hit point per hour spent within the circle.

(Naturally, this is damage above and beyond any caused by the weapon that injects the poison.) Even if he succeeds in the save, the victim still sustains a lesser amount of damage, as shown in the second figure. Instead of creating an insinuative poison (one that is introduced to the body through a cut), the wizard can instead conjure the venom as a contact poison. A surface of about one-half square foot per caster level can be affected. One square foot is enough to coat a doorknob, a sword-hilt, the handle or clasp of a chest, or an object of similar size. The contact poison has the same effects as the insinuative venom, but the victim gains a +2 bonus on his saving throws. The contact poison’s toxicity fades at the end of the spell’s duration. The material component is a small vial of venom from a giant snake."

The spell creates an invisible barrier that blocks the targeted area. Any nonspellcasters and those spellcasters specifically named by the caster may pass freely. All other spellcasters collide with the invisible barrier. Members of classes with lesser spellcasting abilities (paladins, rangers, and bards) are blocked only if the character is of sufficient level to cast spells. The wizard is able to ward one area up to 20'-square for each level of his experience. Thus, a 12th-level wizard may protect a square area 240 feet on a side. The area of effect may be divided among several smaller portals as long as the total area does not exceed the caster's limit. Each portal must be in range and sight of the caster at the time the spell is cast. The barriers exist for one hour per level of the caster unless they are dismissed by the caster or dispelled by a dispel magic spell. A disintegrate spell immediately destroys a barrier, as does a rod of cancellation or a sphere of annihilation. The invisible walls are not affected by physical blows, cold, heat, or electricity. Thrown and projected weapons (both magical and mundane) are not repelled by the barrier and may pass through the area normally. Spells can be cast through the barrier. Dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barriers. The material component is a pinch of dust from any wizard's tomb."

On the second round, a 7'-tall, multicolored tornado appears. From this moment on, the caster must maintain concentration in order for the vortex to remain. Each round, the caster can move the vortex 60 feet. However, control of direction is not perfect. The caster has complete control over distance, but can only suggest the desired direction. The caster has a 50% chance of moving the vortex in the direction he desires; if the die roll indicates failure, the vortex moves according to the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles. Thus, the vortex usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move to either side or directly toward the caster. The vortex cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these, rebounding along the general line of movement. For example, if cast in a narrow hallway, the vortex might ricochet down the hall, bouncing from side to side. The vortex is composed of raw magical energy. Nonmagical creatures struck by the vortex suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster. Magical creatures and spellcasters suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. Creatures struck are allowed a saving throw vs. magic to suffer only half damage. Each time a creature is struck, there is a 5% chance that the vortex will explode in a wild surge. Use Table 2 to determine the results of any wild surge. If the vortex causes a wild surge, the spell ends immediately. The material components are a silk streamer and a handful of straw."

The spell creates an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-foot square per level of the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet for every two levels of experience of the wizard, and 20 feet high. The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 4d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, to any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult. A successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on.

This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is ½-inch thick per level of experience of the spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an iron wall of up to 15 square feet per experience level; thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of iron with an area of 180 square feet. The wizard can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. If the caster desires, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush any creature beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction. This chance can be modified by a force of not less than 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass--each pound over 400 or Strength point over 30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the stronger side. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saving throws vs. death. Those who fail are killed. Huge and gargantuan creatures cannot be crushed by the wall. The wall is permanent, unless successfully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a normal iron wall is subject to--rust, perforation, etc. The material component of this spell is a small piece of sheet iron."

The wall of stone is 0.25 inch thick and up to 20 square feet per level of experience of the wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of stone 3 inches thick and up to 240 square feet in surface area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high wall, for example, to completely close a 10-foot x 16-foot passage). The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation (see the wall of iron spell); however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the area of effect by half. Thus, a 20thlevel caster can create a span with a surface area of 200 square feet. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. The stone is permanent unless destroyed by a dispel magic or disintegrate spell, or by normal means such as breaking or chipping. The material component is a small block of granite."

		"description": "The great, powerful, and aged Waltraud created this spell to replace wall sections in her manor with one way windows that also functioned as emergency escape routes. Glass was removed, and the Wall of Wonder (also known as the Waltraud's One Way Window) was cast in it's place. From the inside, this section is mostly transparent and can be walked through. Any object or creature passing through the wall disrupts the wall for 1 round. Casual inspection from the inside shows the form and some visual details of the illusion. From the outside, the wall appears to conforms to the surface details of the surrounding wall, up to and including touch and pressure. The wall will physically resist outside pressure, impact, and forces as if made from the same material surrounding it with a thickness of one inch. Thus a Wall of Wonder will look, feel, and behave as a real wall would to one on the outside, but act as an opening to one on the inside. This spell must be cast in such a way as to seal or plug a hole in an otherwise functional wall, tunnel, portal, etc. It must connect with real and solid materials on all 4 sides made of the same material. Should a section of wall or material that the spell connects to be destroyed or removed, the spell fizzles. The wall provides no support to things above, below, beside or behind it. For example, the spell could fill a stone doorway, but not a stone doorway with a wooden threshold or baseboard.  Missile fire through the wall from the inside is possible, as is spell casting, but either of these actions will cause the illusion to vanish for 1 round. Should the illusion rematerialize while something is in it's path, it will spend another round inactive. Horses, dogs, and other simple animals may be confused or spooked by semitransparent nature of the wall (from the inside) and may hesitate to pass through it unless they are carefully coaxed. Like all things, once an animal becomes used to the wall, it may pass through it with only minor hesitation. Training a war horse to charge, or a messenger bird to fly, through Waltraud's Wall of Wonder is difficult. The accompanying 2nd level, 'Reveal Wonderous Walls' spell disrupts Waltraud's Wall of Wonder if cast directly on a segment of the wall. Detect magic cast from the outside will not reveal the wonderous nature of the wall. An Identify spell cast on a wall segment will reveal its nature, but is impractical for finding hidden wall segments as its casting time is so long and its materials so expensive. To cast the spell, first the caster outlines a 1 foot square section with both hands while speaking the words, then they blow mithril dust onto that segment of wall before moving onto the next area and repeating the process until the whole wall is done. All segments must be completed in one casting and without interruption. Interruption breaks the casting, fizzling the existing wall sections. The wall may be no smaller than 1 square foot, no larger than 300 square feet. For every 1 hour of casting, the caster must make a constitution check to maintain the exact detail of concentration. Failure indicates the caster has made a small mistake the the spell fails."

The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect. After casting waveform, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use waveform to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs. The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the waveform moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed. If propelled against a target, the waveform causes ld4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The waveform can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage. If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water's speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current. Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the waveform. If the waveform is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the DMG). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made. Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made. The material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp. The oar disintegrates when the spell is cast."

Unlike an elemental, an aerial servant cannot be commanded to fight for the caster. When it is summoned, the priest must have cast a protection from evil spell, be within a protective circle, or have a special item used to control the aerial servant. Otherwise, it attempts to slay its summoner and return from whence it came. The object or creature to be brought must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the priest (an aerial servant can carry at least 1,000 pounds). If prevented, for any reason, from completing the assigned duty, the aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the priest releases it, or the priest is slain. The spell lasts for a maximum of one day for each level of experience of the priest who cast it. If the creature to be fetched cannot detect invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks, automatically gaining surprise. If the creature involved can detect invisible objects, it still suffers a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls caused by the aerial servant. Each round of combat, the aerial servant must roll to attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for. A creature with a Strength rating is allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its [pi]bend bars[xpi] chance, to escape the hold. If the creature in question does not have a Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the aerial servant and the creature grabbed have. The higher total is the stronger. Once seized, the creature cannot free itself by Strength or Dexterity and is flown to the priest forthwith."

Human and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in the Player's Handbook. The Player's Handbook also provides rules for determining a character's base age. Nonmagical monsters can be affected by age creature. The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger). Age Penalty Middle Age -1 to all saving throws Old Age -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls Venerable -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls The material component is a pinch of powdered emerald.

The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever[md]wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet[md]a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks."

Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there.

		"description": "Bigby's forceful hand is a more powerful version of Bigby's interposing hand. It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that places itself between the spellcaster and a chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to get around it. However, the forceful hand also pushes on the opponent. This force can push away a creature weighing 500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs more than 2,000 pounds. A creature pushed away is pushed to the range limit, or until pressed against an unyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no damage. The forceful hand has an Armor Class of 20, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed. The caster can cause it to retreat (to release a trapped opponent, for example) or dismiss it on command. The material component is a glove."

		"description": "This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke of lightning, 2' feet wide, commencing from the fingertips of the caster. Unlike a lightning bolt spell, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to a series of other objects or creatures within range, losing energy with each jump. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt. The chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike. Direction is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor- -an arc cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell's range, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck, even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster! The material components are a bit of fur, a piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and one silver pin for each experience level of the caster."

The creature must have an Intelligence of at least 1 in order to be affected by this spell; nonintelligent creatures (those with a score of 0) cannot comprehend any order, no matter how the priest phrases it. Other creatures gain a saving throw vs. spell to resist command monster, but only if they have an Intelligence of Exceptional (15) or better, or the creature's levels or Hit Dice are equal to or greater than the caster's. Just like the 1st-level spell command, this spell coerces the subject into obeying the priest's one-word order to the best of its ability. The order must be absolutely clear and unequivocal; the subject will continue to obey for one round per two caster levels- six rounds at 12th level, seven at 14th, and so on. If this action places the subject in mortal peril, he may attempt a saving throw (whether he was originally entitled to one or not) in order to break free of the spell's power. Therefore, ordering a character standing at the edge of a cliff to 'jump' will create an opportunity for the subject to break free. A command to 'die' or 'sleep' renders the creature unconscious for the spell's duration. Undead creatures are immune to this spell."

The contingency spell and the spell it is to bring into effect are cast at the same time (the one-turn casting time indicated is the total for both castings). The spell to be brought into effect by the prescribed contingency must be one that affects the wizard's person (feather fall, levitation, fly, feign death, etc.) and be of a spell level no higher than 1/3 of the caster's experience level (rounded down), but not higher than the 6th spell level. (See book for table ). Only one contingency spell can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is cancelled. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be rather general. For example, a contingency spell cast with an airy water spell might prescribe that any time the wizard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the airy water spell will instantly come into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being 'cast' instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell complex (the contingency spell and the companion magic) may fail when called upon. The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the companion spell) 100gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature. In addition, the spell requires a statuette of the wizard carved from elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, though it is subject to wear and tear), which must be carried on the person of the spellcaster for the contingency spell to perform its function when called upon."

Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart. The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.

Such creatures cannot be raised or resurrected, but an individual slain in this manner might be brought back via a wish. The number of creatures that can be slain is a function of their Hit Dice. (See book for table ). In other words, from the 4d20 roll subtract the number of creatures of less than 2 Hit Dice (these creatures die). If there are any remaining points from the 4d20 roll, subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit Dice (these creatures also die). If this still doesn't use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 for each creature of 4+1 to 6+3 Hit Dice, and so on. Stop when all the creatures are dead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the remainder is less than half the CF of any remaining creatures. (If the remainder is one-half or more of the CF of a creature, that creature dies.) For example, a mixed group of 20 goblins, eight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill giant, are caught in the area of a death spell. The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of this eliminates the goblins (20 x 1 CF), 16 kills the gnolls (8 x 2 CF), and the remaining 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one ogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres and the hill giant are unharmed. A death spell does not affect lycanthropes, undead creatures, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material. The material component of this spell is a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 1,000 gp."

		"description": "This spell makes a single weapon incredibly sharp by reducing one of its physical dimensions to an infinitesimal measurement. The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe. Against creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent's AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 20, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 15. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM's discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments-muscle power doesn't help the blade at all. The dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blades length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It's dangerous to attempt to disarm a dimensional blade; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration or be destroyed. Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses. The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass."

While disbelief remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from their attacks or actions. However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him). The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20- cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster. These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both. Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc. Disbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence. While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs. spell.

With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted. The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process. The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.) At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again. Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours o the last, even if the prior spell failed. No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose. The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of kirin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.  "

		"description": "Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared. When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster. A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free. The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the handmade circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%. Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it. Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature. The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge."

		"description": "This potent defense surrounds the caster in a chaotic maelstrom of energy and demimatter that blocks or deflects many attacks. The entropy shield extends about two feet in all directions from the caster's body. The warping effect of the field causes any melee or hand-to-hand attack to miss 50% of the time-even if the roll allows an attack to continue, the priest still gains a -2 bonus to his Armor Class. Normal missiles or hurled weapons miss automatically as the entropy shield deflects them from the caster. Even magical missile attacks (produce flame, magic missile, or Melf's acid arrow, for example), siege engines, and giant-thrown boulders may be deflected as if they were hand-to-hand attacks. Against spells or effects that produce energy, gas, or other physical attack forms (fireball, lightning bolt, cloudkill, and other such spells) the entropy shield provides a 50% chance that the attack simply does not affect the protected priest. Even if the harmful energy or matter penetrates the shield, the caster gains a +2 bonus on his saving throw. This does not cause a spell to fizzle or fail; a priest standing in the middle of a fireball is simply not touched by the spell, which will inflict its normal damage on anyone else in the area of effect. Any spell or effect that does not create matter or energy Entropy Shield to harm or hinder the victim can pass through the entropy shield normally, so mind-based attacks and magical effects such as petrification, paralyzation, enfeeblement, or polymorph (to name a few) can still affect the priest. In addition to its defensive benefits, the entropy shield has the ability to repel normal or giant-sized animals and creatures of lawful alignment, such as extraplanar monsters from the lawful planes. Any such creature attempting to attack the shielded priest in hand-to-hand combat must roll a saving throw vs. spell at the end of the round. If the creature fails, it recoils from the priest and cannot attack him physically for the remainder of the spell's duration (although it could decide to turn on one of the priest's companions). The material component for this spell is a gemstone worth at least 100 gold pieces that has been exposed to the chaotic energies of Limbo."

No physical, or magical attack can affect him, unless his assailant is ethereal as well (although some monsters, such as basilisk, have gaze weapons whose power extends into the ethereal plane). The spell recipients are actually in the Border ethereal and can still perceive their physically surroundings, but the world appears gray, misty, and indistinct to them. Note that as ethereal creatures can perceive the physically world here, a character could scout out his surroundings or make good an escape from the safety of the Border ethereal. The wizard and his companions may remain in the border ethereal for up to normal existence, although the wizard can choose to end the spell before its full duration. The wizard also has the option the Deep ethereal, in which case they remain ethereal when the spell ends. He will have to use this spell again or find another way back in order to return to his home plane.  The wizard can attempt to use etherealness to banish an unwilling subject. He must make a successful attack roll in order to touch him, and the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. An unwilling subject automatically remains in the Border ethereal for an amount of time specified by the wizard at the time of the casting, but no more than one hour per caster level. When used like this, etherealness does not affect the caster, only the subject. "

		"description": "An eyebite spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows: Charm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses. Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear. Sicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak, a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack. Sleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness. In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered."

The locale can be outdoors or under ground, a trap, or even a maze spell. Note that the spell works with respect to locales, not objects or creatures within a locale. Thus, the spell could not find the way to 'a forest where a green dragon lives' or to the location of 'a hoard of platinum pieces.' The location must be in the same plane as the caster. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead him to his destination, indicating at the appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, with concentration the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph. The spell ends when the destination is reached or when one turn for each caster level has elapsed. The spell frees the subject, and those with him, from a maze spell in a single round, and will continue to do so as long as the spell lasts. Note that this divination is keyed to the caster, not his companions, and that, like the find traps spell, it does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures. The spell requires a set of divination counters of the sort favored by the priest--bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, or whatever. The reverse spell, lose the path, makes the creature touched totally lost and unable to find its way for the duration of the spell--although it can be led, of course."

An attack roll is required to strike the intended target, and proficiency penalties are considered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage and igniting any combustible materials within a 10-foot diameter of the point of impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is made, a creature within the burst area receives only one-half damage, but a creature struck directly suffers full damage (i.e., no saving throw). Fire seed incendiaries: This casting turns up to eight holly berries into special incendiaries. The holly berries are most often placed, being too light to make effective missiles. They can be tossed only up to 6 feet away. They burst into flame if the caster is within 40 yards and speaks a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 1d8 points of damage to any creature and igniting any combustible within a 5-foot-diameter burst area. Creatures within the area that successfully save vs. spell suffer half damage. All fire seeds lose their power after a duration equal to one turn per experience level of the caster--e.g., the seeds of a 13th-level caster remain potent for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation.

Otherwise, the effect on those entering the enchanted area is based on their alignment, relative to the caster's. The most severe penalty is used. Alignment identical: No effect. If password locked, cannot enter area unless password is known (no saving throw). Alignment different with respect to law and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if failed, suffer 2d6 points of damage. If password locked, cannot enter unless password is known. Alignment different with respect to good and evil: Save vs. spell to enter this area; if failed, suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word locked, cannot enter unless password is known. The attempt does cause damage if the save is failed. Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder cannot enter the forbidden area until the spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled by a caster of lesser level than the one who established it. Intruders who enter by rolling successful saving throws feel uneasy and tense, despite their success. In addition to the priest's holy symbol, components include holy water and rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that are likely to result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of action.

The greater sign has several effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance) as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass. Second, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign. Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign's retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance. The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled. The material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000gp."

The whole area radiates magic. The normal use of the detect magic spell becomes impossible for those of less than the caster's level and difficult for others. 6. One door per level of experience of the wizard is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall 7. The wizard can place one of the following additional magical effects: A. Dancing lights in four corridors. B. A magic mouth in two places. C. A stinking cloud in two places. D. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. E. A suggestion in one place. Note that items 6 and 7 function only when the wizard is totally familiar with the area of the spell's effect. Dispel magic can remove one effect, at random, per casting. A remove curse spell will not work. The material components of the spell are burning incense, a small measure of sulphur and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod."

If the save is failed, the victim will never willingly violate the stated law as long as the spell is in effect. Legal thoughts can be negated by dispel magic.

If the person or thing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the place in question, the likelihood of the spell producing results is far greater and the casting time is only 1d4 turns. If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks. During the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary. For example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, 'Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.' Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow. The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc."

While a liveoak spell cast by a particular caster is in effect, he cannot cast another such spell. The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's dwelling place, within a place sacred to the caster, or within 100 yards of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect. The liveoak spell can be cast upon a healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, according to desire and availability. A triggering phrase of up to maximum of one word per level of the spellcaster is then placed upon the targeted oak. For instance, 'Attack any persons who come near without first saying sacred mistletoe' is an 11-word trigger phrase that could be used by a caster of 11th level or higher casting the spell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant of equivalent size, an Armor Class of 0 and with two attacks per round, but with only a 30-feet-per-round movement rate.

If dispelled, the tree takes root immediately. If released by the caster, it tries to return to its original location before taking root. Damage to the tree can be healed with a plant growth spell, which restores 3d4 points of damage. A plant growth spell used in this fashion does not increase the size or hit points of the liveoak beyond the original value. The caster needs his holy symbol to cast this spell."

The water can be lowered up to 2 feet for every experience level of the wizard, to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The water is lowered within a square area whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, a 12th-level wizard affects a volume of 24 feet x 120 feet x 120 feet, a 13th-level caster a volume of 26 feet x 130 feet x 130 feet, and so on.

When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: The creature moves at half speed and makes half the number of attacks each round. It has no effect on other creatures. The material component of this spell is a small vial of dust. Its reverse, raise water, causes water or similar fluids to return to their highest natural level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This can make fords impassable, float grounded ships, and may even sweep away bridges, at the DM's option.

Thus, embankments can be collapsed, hillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. However, in no event can rock prominences be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected dictates the casting time; for every 40 yard x 40 yard surface area and 10 feet of depth, one turn of casting time is required. The maximum area that can be affected is 240 yards x 240 yards, which takes four hours. If terrain features are to be moved--as compared to simply caving in banks or walls of earth--it is necessary that an earth elemental be subsequently summoned to assist. All spell casting or summoning must be completed before any effects occur. As any summoned earth elemental will perform most of its work underground, it is unlikely that it will be intercepted or interrupted. Should this occur, however, the movement of the earth requiring its services must be stopped until the elemental is once again available. Should the elemental be slain or dismissed, the move earth spell is limited to collapsing banks or walls of earth. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures; its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle. The material components for this spell are a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a small bag and an iron blade. Note: This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, etc. are relatively unaffected, save for changes in elevation and relative topography."

A small globe of matter at absolute zero temperature that spreads upon contact with water, or a liquid that is principally water, freezing it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the spellcaster. This ice lasts for one round per level of the caster. The material component is a thin sheet of crystal about an inch square. B) Cold ray. The spell can be used as a thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4+2 points of damage per level of the caster upon the first creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed). If the first creature is missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its full distance, and anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or suffer appropriate damage. The material component is a white sapphire of not less than 1,000gp value. C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful). Use the Grenadelike Missile Table in the Dungeon Master Guide to find where misses strike. Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within one round per level of the spellcaster, it shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well. The material component is a 1,000gp diamond."

Any missile weapon or spell that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180 degree arc. The sender of the spell or missile finds himself the target of his own attack. The physical mirror operates from only one direction; that is, only one side of the mirror reflects attacks. The caster of the mirror may direct spells and missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror. In the case of physical attacks, the attacker must roll to hit himself (without the armor class benefits of Dexterity or shield). Spells turned back may require the caster to make a saving throw vs. his own spell. In both of these cases, range is important. If the distance between the initiator of the attack and the physical mirror is more than twice the range of the attack, the attacker is safe; the attack has insufficient range to travel from the attacker to the mirror and back again. When the priest casts the spell, he must specify the location and orientation of the physical mirror disk. Once it is created, the disk cannot be moved. If two physical mirror disks touch or intersect, they destructively interact and both immediately vanish. The resulting 'ripples' in the space-time continuum are exceedingly destructive and inflict 3d10 hit points of damage on any creature within 35 yards (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage). This always includes the casters of the physical mirror spells. The material component is a tiny mirror of polished platinum, worth at least 500 gp."

		"description": "To prepare for this spell, the caster must build a very hot fire. This can be through making a large fire, or a small fire of materials that burn very hot. The caster must also have an amount of sand on hand. Once the fire has reached the required intensity, the caster imbues a handful of sand with the magic of the spell and tosses it into the flames where they are quickly and brightly incinerated in an instant, and altering the flames to act as a window into the past.  Any who look upon the flames will see the same event or location as if viewed through a window whose shape flickers with the flame. The caster chooses a location and a time when enchanting the first handful of sand, and can change location and time with each subsequent imbued handful they add to the fire. The location must be public, something generally accessible to anyone, unless the caster adds to the fire a flammable personal affect of a specific person whose past they wish to view. The item should be relatively whole and personal in nature. Alternatively, a drop of blood or the root of a hair, freshly procured in the last 24 hours, may be used in lieu of a personal item. The location can be changed with a handful of sand. Regardless whether the caster is viewing a public area, or a specific person, a room lined with lead or silver will block the spell and the caster will see nothing but flames. The time frame is limited to the past, viewed in real time, and limited to increments of exactly 1 year. Should a caster wish to view the events of the previous day, they would have to wait a year minus a day to see them. The time may be changed with a handful of sand to any increment of 1 year that they wish. Postcognition can be channeled for as long as the caster is no more than 15 from the flames, their intensity is maintained, and the caster maintains concentration on the spell. They may converse with those around them as long as it is about what is happening in the fires. Other conversation is too distracting and will cause the caster to falter. Taking damage requires making a saving throw to maintain concentration. Because the onlooker sees the events only where flames are, one bigger or closer the flames, the better view the onlooker will have. Frequent users of this spell often have singed hairs and small burns on themselves, as well as a distant and unchanging gaze that feels removed from the world."

It can be of any object, creature, or force, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The occurrence that begins the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, such as the following: 'Begin only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged within one foot of this spot.' Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level wizard can command the programmed illusion to occur at a maximum encounter range of 60 yards. A programmed illusion cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word. The spell lasts until the illusion occurs; thus, the spell duration is variable. The illusion will last for a maximum of one round per level of the spellcaster. Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, see it for what it is and add +4 bonuses to associates' saving throws, if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect are immune until they become aware of it. The illusion is subject to a dispel magic spell. The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece."

The priest may use the spell on himself or any creature he touches. Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the entrapment. While inside the space, the enclosed character is invisible and totally undetectable by any form of scrying. Powerful magic such as contact other plane will indicate that the character is 'elsewhere,' but will give no more information. The creature within the extradimensional space can see and hear everything that occurs around him. However, he cannot cast spells, and no action of his can affect anyone or anything in the 'real world.' While occupied, the extradimensional space is totally immobile. If the caster chooses to occupy the space, he can pass in and out of the space at will. Other creatures can leave or reenter the space only if the caster allows it. To an outside observer, an enclosed character who exits the space simply appears from nowhere. If the space is occupied when the spell terminates, the occupant is immediately ejected back into the real world and suffers 1d6 hit points of damage in the process. Any time the extradimensional space is empty, or when the occupant is someone other than the priest, the space follows the priest around. Thus, the priest may seclude a comrade in the extradimensional space, walk past some guards into a building, then release the comrade. If any other form of extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding ) is taken into the space created by seclusion, both spaces are ruptured and all contents are expelled onto the Astral plane. Extradimensional manipulation can temporarily prevent this. The material components are a tiny crystal box of the finest workmanship (worth at least 1,500 gp) and a gem of at least 250 gp value. The gem is consumed in the casting; the box is not."

It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw. The stone can be hurled up to 30 yards. The priest must roll normally to hit; he gains a +3 bonus to his attack roll and suffers no penalty for nonweapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem is considered a +3 weapon for determining whether a creature can be struck (creatures hit only by magical weapons, for example). There is no damage bonus, however. When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds him for 1d6 rounds. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, only half damage is sustained and the target is not blinded. Undead creatures suffer 12d6 points of damage and are blinded for 2d6 rounds (if applicable) if their save is failed. They receive 6d6 points of damage and are blinded for 1d6 rounds if the save is successful. If the gem misses its target, it explodes immediately, causing 3d6 points of damage (or 6d6 against undead) to all creatures within a 3' radius. It blinds them for 1d3 rounds (1d6 rounds vs. undead). All victims are allowed a saving throw vs. spell, with success indicating half damage and no blindness. The DM should use the rules for grenade-like missiles found in the Dungeon Master Guide for determining where the stone hits. The material component is a topaz gemstone worth at least 500 gp."

The casting effort severely weakens the priests, discouraging casual use of this spell. To cast the spell, six or more priests must be within a 15-foot radius. Each priest must cast spiritual wrath at the same time. Before beginning the spell, the priests must decide upon the area of effect. The spell causes 10d6+1d6 points of damage per priest casting the spell. (The minimum damage, therefore, is 16d6.) Creatures within the area of effect are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage to half. The spell strikes as a great wave of force that descends from the sky. Small objects must save vs. crushing blow. Structures suffer damage as if hit by a heavy catapult (2d12). The force of this spell often raises a great cloud of dirt and dust, obscuring the area for 1d4+1 rounds. The spell's area of effect is determined by the number of casters. Each priest contributes 10 feet to the radius of the spell. Six casters would create a spell with a radius of 60 feet. No more than twelve casters can cooperate to cast this spell (maximum of 22d6 damage and a 120-foot radius area of effect). This converts to an 8-inch circle in the BATTLESYSTEM rules ground scale.

		"description": "When this spell is cast, the wizard designates one inanimate object of stone, earth, or metal within the spell's range to function as a powerful magnet, attracting all metal. The object affected can be no larger than a 10-feet cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force(caster's choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below .See book for table.  The movement rate represent how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective strength is the pull of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapons sizes. A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win opposed strength check  (see player option: combat& tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM's discretion. Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item- 1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that ground if the character passes his strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron wearing characters in their strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature's size to the effective size of magnetism. An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal. The material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a u-shape and coated with mithril."

Because of the nature of this spell and its casting time, it is often used to cleanse grounds in preparation for the construction of a temple or sanctuary. When casting the great circle, the priests stand in a circle of no more than 20-foot diameter. Each faces inward; when the spell is completed, each priest faces outward, directing the energy of the spell. When the casting is complete, the spell takes the form of a radiant halo of golden light 20 feet above the ground. This halo quickly expands in a shimmering wave. It can pass through objects, with small arcs of the halo disappearing momentarily and reappearing on the far side. As the halo moves, it generates a high-pitched hum that varies in pitch, almost like a chorus. The halo moves slowly at first, but builds speed, reaching its maximum range at the end of one round. The radius of the golden halo is dependent on the number of priests casting the spell. Each priest adds 60 feet to the radius. Thus, four priests could generate a halo that extends 240 feet in all directions from the circle of priests. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of priests who may contribute to this spell, but the need for the priests to be within a 20-foot diameter circle sets a practical limit of 20 casters. The halo is pure energy tapped from the Positive Material plane. It causes harm to undead and evil beings within the area of effect. Undead creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice are instantly destroyed and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect. More powerful undead suffer 1d8 points of damage per caster. A successful saving throw vs. death magic reduces this damage to half. Creatures of evil alignment suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage). The reverse of this spell, the black circle, creates a ring of shimmering black energy. Paladins and priests of good alignment suffer 1d10 points of damage per priest in the circle. All other good creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per caster. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to reduce the damage to one-half."

The reverse of this spell is simply a very high-powered create water spell that requires a pinch of normal dust as an additional material component. For either usage of the spell, other components required are diamond dust of at least 500 gp value, a bit of sea shell, and the caster's holy symbol."

While the spell is in effect, the caster regenerates 3 hit points per round until he reaches his normal maximum.

If the caster is reduced to less than 0 hit points, he is incapacitated and must make a system shock roll or lose all of his highest level spells. The incapacitation lasts only until his regeneration restores him to 1 hit point or more; he can move fight, and cast spells again as soon as his hit point total is positive. Trollish fortitude does not provide the caster with any defenses against lethal position, disease, and other effects level draining, vampiric touch, or vampiric regeneration cannot be regenerated since this represents damage to the victim's life force and not physical injury. In addition, fire damage and acid damage cannot be regenerated. While the spell is in effect, the caster can rejoin severed limbs simply by holding them in place, but if the spell ends while a limb(which were already moving toward him) is still separate from his body, he immediately suffers the full effects of the injury. The material component for this spell is a shred of dried flesh from a troll's heart that must be pulverized into dust. The dust is then sprinkled on the caster."

Wooden objects above 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects (movable mantles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects less than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of force. Thus, objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are turned, although an anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn wood spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the caster. The waves of force continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration, pushing back wooden objects in the area of effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round. The length of the path is 20 feet per level of the caster. Thus if a 14th-level priest casts a turn wood spell, the area of effect is 120 feet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell lasts 14 rounds.

Any creature breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 points of damage, plus an additional amount of damage equal to the creature's AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage, but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast, crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier. If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall. The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command."

In autumn, hot or cold weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be summoned. Winter enables great cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the later winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the caster. It might last but a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 square miles. Note that several casters can act in concert to greatly affect weather, controlling winds, and working jointly to summon very extreme weather conditions. Within four turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather to come is apparent-- e.g., clearing skies, gusts of warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast skies, etc. Summoned weather arrives 1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast.

The whirlwind can move by zigzagging along the ground or over water at a movement rate of 6. The whirlwind always moves after all other creatures have moved, and many creatures can avoid it simply by keeping their distance. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds-possibly endangering the caster or his allies-and then dissipates. Any creature of size L (large) or smaller that comes in contact with the whirlwind must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon or suffer 2d8 damage. Size M (man-sized) or smaller creatures who fail their first saving throw must attempt a second one, or be picked up bodily by the whirlwind and held suspended in its powerful winds, suffering 1d8 points of damage each round with no save allowed. The caster may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever he wishes, depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens to be when they are released. Maintaining the whirlwind requires the caster's full attention, and he cannot cast other spells or make any attacks while directing the spell's course. If his concentration fails for some reason, he cannot simply cancel the spell. Instead, the spell becomes uncontrolled as described above and dissipates after 1d3 rounds. In truly desperate circumstances, priests of elemental air have been known to deliberately overrun their companions in order to carry them out of the path of some certain doom. Few care to repeat the experience. The material component for this spell is a handful of dust collected from a zephyr or snow from a williwaw."

A dragon's age cannot be reduced below hatchling or increased beyond great wyrm. Unwilling dragons are allowed a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty to avoid the effect. A dragon affected by age dragon temporarily acquires the armor class, hit points, spell abilities, combat modifiers, size, and other attributes of his new age level.

If the dragon loses more hit points at his modified age than he has at his actual age, he dies when the spell expires. For example, a young adult bronze dragon with 110 hit points is aged to a mature adult with 120 hit points. The dragon suffers 115 hit points in combat. Unless the dragon is healed of 6 points of damage before the spell expires, the dragon dies at the end of the spell since his damage is greater than his actual hit points.

The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest.

The roll is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the undead has a higher score, the difference is added to the die roll. If the necromancer has a higher Intelligence, the difference is subtracted from the roll. If the roll is successful, nothing happens and the caster may continue to possess the undead. If the Intelligence roll fails, the wizard's intellect degenerates, making him a raving, homicidal maniac. His spirit is immediately forced to return to his body, and he must attempt a system shock roll with damage occurring as outlined above. The caster remains dangerously insane until a heal or wish spell is used to restore his intellect. This spell can be very useful when combined with the mask of death spell. When the spell's duration expires, the necromancer's spirit immediately returns to his body."

		"description": "This powerful spell enables the caster to cure many persons (even an entire community) who are afflicted with a nonmagical disease. The priest need not touch or even see the diseased people for the spell to be effective, although recipients must be within the area of effect. This spell does not cure all diseases in the community at one time; the caster must specifically state which disease is to be eliminated (black plague or yellow fever, for example) with each casting of the spell. When the spell is cast, the priest exhales a sweet-smelling breath. This forms into a breeze that radiates outward, forming a circle that expands in a 50-yard radius per hour. During this time, the caster must remain at the center of the area of effect. For example, after 12 hours, the breath of life would cover a circle 1200 yards in diameter (600-yard radius). The breath is of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected by prevailing winds. The breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified disease from all afflicted citizens. The breath of life spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs, and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed. The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion. The breath of death, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell. Victims who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw. Infected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person). The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust taken from a mummy's corpse."

When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation, the staff turns into a treantlike creature with 12 Hit Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It attacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points of damage with every successful attack. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels, until the caster commands the staff to return to its true form, or until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a sawdustlike powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used again after 24 hours and the stafftreant is at full strength. To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash, oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff. The staff for the changestaff spell must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew tree struck by lightning no more than 24 hours before the limb is cut. The limb must then be cured by sun drying and special smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped, carved, and polished for another 28 days. The caster cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during either of these periods. The finished staff, engraved with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is thrust into the earth of the caster's grove while he casts a speak with plant spell, calling upon the staff to assist in time of need. The item is then charged with a magic that will last for many changes from staff to treant and back again."

These appear in a clap of thunder amid a cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on the ground, 48 flying, and can carry the caster and up to seven other creatures of man-size or less. The passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them from the flames of the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and his designated passengers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each round if they come within 5 feet of the horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no damage if they evade the area by rolling successful saving throws vs. petrification, with Dexterity adjustments. The caster controls the chariot by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds to stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn left or right as he desires. Note that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2, and each requires 30 points of damage to dispel. Naturally, fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a successful dispel magic or holy word, will force the chariot back to its home plane, without its passengers. The chariot can be summoned only once per week. The material components are a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire source at least equal to a torch."

		"description": "This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action.

Thus, seven to ten creatures can be affected by a 12thor 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a 14th- or 15th-level caster, etc. These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10): d10 Reaction 1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again) 7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) 10 Act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail their saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round, for the duration of the spell, or until the 'wander away for the duration of the spell' result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing, flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells. Note: If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stands confused, four attack, and one acts normally."

Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart: Precipitation Temperature Wind CLEAR HOT CALM very clear sweltering heat dead calm light clouds or hazy warm light wind PARTLY CLOUDY WARM moderate wind clear weather hot MODERATE WIND cloudy cool calm mist/light rain/hail COOL strong wind sleet/light snow warm STRONG WIND CLOUDY cold moderate wind partly cloudy COLD gale deep clouds cool GALE fog arctic cold strong wind heavy rain/large hail storm gale driving sleet/snow STORM hurricane The upper-case headings represent existing weather conditions. The lower-case headings below are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. In addition, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear, warm, and with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession. The material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol, incense, and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously, the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions. If Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids), duration and area are doubled, and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places. For example, he can cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool to arctic, and wind to go from calm to strong."

Upon command from the caster, the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet per round toward any prey within 80 yards, moving in the direction in which the caster commands. The creeping doom slays any creature subject to normal attacks, as each of the small horrors inflicts 1 point of damage (each then dies after its attack), so that up to 1,000 points of damage can be inflicted on creatures within the path of the creeping doom.

Creatures are entitled to a normal saving throw vs. spell to withstand the spell. The form of insanity caused by the spell is determined by a roll on the chart: See chart for table. The various types of insanity and their game effects are described under the Alienist in Chapter 6. The caster has no idea what kind of madness the spell inflicts on its victim, although he may be able to form an educated guess after observing the victim for a few rounds. Descent into madness accelerates the process of insanity radically, producing an advanced condition almost immediately; for example, a character rendered paranoid by this spell skips past suspicion and instantly regards his friends and allies as enemies of the worst sort. The victim has a small chance of recovering with the passage of time (as described under each type of insanity) but other than that the only ways to repair the effects of this spell are restoration, wish, or use of the psionic power psychic surgery.

The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving. To prepare this spell, the wizard must hold a gem of not less than 5,000gp value in his hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. At some point in the future, he must crush the gem and utter the final word. The desired item is then transported instantly into the spellcaster's right or left hand, as he desires. The item must have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell. During the initial incantation, the gem becomes magically inscribed with the name of the item to be summoned. The inscription is invisible and unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast the summons. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, and the caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). Note that special wards or barriers, or factors that block the teleport or plane shift spells, may also block the operation of this spell. Objects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell. Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply.

A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and both law and chaos. The spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest's alignment, then the exaction spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward, and with the being's effort and risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future exaction spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common caster pledges in securing an exaction. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, some matter or substance from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected, and knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge."

Creatures that roll successful saving throws vs. spell suffer only one-half damage. The damage is inflicted each round the creature stays in the area of effect. The area of effect is equal to two 10-foot x 10-foot cubes per level of the cater--e.g., a 13th-level caster can cast a fire storm measuring 130 feet x 20 feet x 10 feet. The height of the storm is 10 or 20 feet; the imbalance of its area must be in length and width. The reverse spell, fire quench, smothers twice the area of effect of a fire storm spell with respect to normal fires, and the normal area of effect with respect to magical fires. Fire-based creatures, such as elementals, salamanders, etc., of less than demigod status have a 5% chance per experience level of the caster of being extinguished. If cast only against a flametongue sword, the sword must roll a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow or be rendered nonmagical. Such a sword in the possession of a creature first receives the creature's saving throw, and if this is successful, the second saving throw is automatically successful."

		"description": "This powerful spell enables the caster to bring into being a cube of force, but it is unlike the magical item of that name in one important respect: The forcecage does not have solid walls of force; it has alternating bands of force with ½-inch gaps between. Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures within the area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage. A creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the expiration of the spell. By means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power. Although the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, in memorization, the diamond dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the wizard must then toss the dust into the air and it will disappear."

The result of this connection is that the sought-after being can step through the gate or portal, from its plane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell attracts the attention of the dweller on the other plane. When casting the spell, the priest must name the entity he desires to make use of the gate and to come to his aid. There is a 100% chance that something steps through the gate. The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors, including the alignment of the priest, the nature of those accompanying him, and who or what opposes or threatens the priest. The DM will decide the exact result of the spell, based on the creature called, the desires of the caster and the needs of the moment. The being gates in either returns immediately or remains to take action. Casting this spell ages the priest five years."

The road is approximately one foot thick and hovers in the air. It has the texture and color of black granite. Characters and creatures can move on the hovering road at their normal movement rate, ignoring the effects of surrounding terrain. The hovering road must originate from a solid surface. Once anchored, the caster controls the contour of the road, causing it to rise and fall as he wishes. The road can thus be used to traverse rivers (if the road is anchored on the shore), swamps, and similarly hostile terrain. The caster can cause the hovering road to rise over a jungle or cross a chasm. The road has AC 0. It is impervious to non-magical weapons. If the road suffers 100 points of damage (from magical weapons or other magical forces), it dissipates in a black mist; all those on the road fall to the ground below. Unless the road is destroyed, the entire hovering road remains intact from beginning to end for the duration of the spell, even if the caster is killed or incapacitated.

		"description": "The ritual required to cast this spell is time-consuming and extremely complex. As its name implies, illusory fortification creates an illusion of a wall of heavy stonework up to 30 feet tall and 160 yards long, topped with crenellations. The illusory wall can be of any color and apparent age, potentially allowing the caster to match the false wall with the real walls of an existing castle. The illusory wall must be continuous (it cannot form two or more shorter walls), but it can follow any corners or bends that the caster desires. In addition to the wall, the spell creates the illusion of constant movement among the crenellations, as if defending troops were moving atop the wall. The formation of the crenellations makes it impossible for a distant observer to determine exactly how many and what types of defenders are present on the illusory fortification. The illusory wall remains in existence for 2d12 hours unless the spell is terminated earlier. The spell has one very significant limitation: it is strictly two-dimensional and is visible from only one side (the side that the caster deems to be the 'outside'). When viewed from the outside, the wall appears real; when viewed from the end, from above, or from the 'inside,' the wall is totally invisible except for a faint outline of the shape of the wall. This means that friendly troops, concealed from enemy view by the illusory wall, can see their opponents clearly. The wall is most effective if friendly troops are informed of the wall's presence and are careful not to walk through the illusion. Such an occurrence does not end the spell, but it will probably advise the enemy of the nature of the wall. Spells cast at the wall and shots fired at the illusory fortification by siege engines appear to strike the wall and inflict normal damage. In reality, the missiles or spells pass through the illusion, possibly striking troops or real fortifications beyond. Such 'hits' do not disturb the illusion. As soon as an enemy unit moves within 10 yards of the illusory fortification, the spell terminates and the wall vanishes. There are two ways in which the spell can be terminated before it expires. First, the priest can terminate the spell at any time. Second, if a friendly unit makes an attack, whether melee or missile combat, through the illusory wall from the 'inside' to the 'outside,' the spell terminates instantly. Once the illusory fortification has been created, the priest does not need to concentrate on the wall. The spell remains in effect even if the casting priest is killed in the interim. The material components are the priest's holy symbol, a handful of stones, powdered mortar, and a gem worth at least 3,000 gp. All components except the holy symbol are consumed in the casting."

The use of a limited wish will not substantially change major realities, nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points (or all hit points for a limited duration) lost by the wizard. It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage, increase duration of some magical effect, cause a creature to be favorably disposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th level or less, and so on (see the 9th-level wish spell). Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.

		"description": "The mind tracker is a magically-created creature which exists only on the Ethereal plane. It is called into existence when the first portion of this spell is cast. When seen (which is seldom), the mind tracker has an indistinct body. It seems to be a near-solid coalescence of the vaporous atmosphere of the Ethereal plane itself. It is a roughly elliptical body with three or more limbs protruding at seemingly random locations. The number and size of these appendages shifts slowly, however, as new ones appear from the mist and old ones disappear. The body of the creature averages 2 feet across and 3 feet long, though this, too, tends to vary from minute to minute. The mind tracker has no discernible eyes, ears, nose, or other organs. It cannot be engaged in combat; if attacked, it simply disappears, to reappear after the danger has passed, or somewhere else entirely if its quarry has moved on. The ceremony which creates the mind tracker takes one turn to perform. Its material components are a whiff of the Ethereal plane's atmosphere and the brain of a lizard. Once the tracker is manifested, it must be assigned a quarry within one hour. If no quarry is designated, the tracker dissipates and the spell is wasted. To assign a quarry to the tracker, the priest must have the quarry within his sight. This includes magical sight such as true seeing, but not remote sighting devices such as crystal balls. With the quarry in sight, the priest mouths the final phrases of the spell. From that point on, the mind tracker is mentally tethered to the victim. It follows its quarry (staying always in the Ethereal plane) wherever it goes. It constantly relays information about the subject to the priest: what it is doing, where it is. The priest does not actually see an image of the quarry, he receives `reports' from the mind tracker. These reports contain only such information as the tracker can gather by looking. It cannot identify people the quarry is talking to, but can describe them in great detail. Nor can it hear anything the quarry or anyone else says, or read writing, but it recognizes and can report the fact that speaking or reading is happening. While the tracker is dogging its quarry, its presence can be felt as an eery, creepy sensation of being watched. If the victim makes an initial save vs. paralyzation, each of the following stages lasts three hours instead of two. For the first two hours, the quarry has a general feeling of ill ease. In the third and fourth hours, the victim is distracted and nervous, and suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws. In the fifth and sixth hours, the victim is convinced someone or something is following him and suffers a -3 penalty on saving throws and a -2 (or -10%) penalty on all other dice rolls. After six hours the victim is near his breaking point. He is unable to concentrate to cast spells or use any of his class's special abilities. All die rolls have a -5 (or -25%) penalty. After eight hours, he must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If he fails, he collapses, fevered and delirious. This state persists until the tracker ceases to exist. The mind tracker continues to exist for as long as the priest remains conscious of its input. If the priest is knocked out or falls asleep, or simply dismisses his creation, the tracker dissipates."

The caster of the spell controls entry to the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind him when he enters. He may open it again from his own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they behold a magnificent foyer and numerous chambers beyond. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to as many dozens of people as the spellcaster has levels of experience. There is a staff of near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. Rest and relaxation within the place is normal, but the food is not. It seems excellent and quite filling as long as one is within the place. Once outside, however, its effects disappear immediately, and if those resting have not eaten real food within a reasonable time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure to eat normal food immediately results in the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties as decided by the DM. The material components of this spell are a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon. These are utterly destroyed when the spell is cast.(It is worth mentioning that this spell has been used in conjunction with a normal portal, as well as with illusion magic.

		"description": "Related to both the contingency and permanency spells, persistence allows a wizard to cast a spell of 6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two general uses for persistence: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the persistence itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it. A. Personal effect. Any spell that augments the wizard’s natural abilities - detect magic, protection from evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform, or other caster-affecting spells-can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts persistence and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the persistence holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then “turn on” or “turn off” the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the persistence. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a fly spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 15 days (the duration of the persistence) as he sees fit. This is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the persistence and have the girded spell’s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and contingency lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a contingency functions once only. B. Held spell. Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like teleport or dimension door, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the persistence, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a contingency spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to. Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, flaming sphere or wall of fire) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one persistence spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is expended when the spell is made persistent."

If the caster desires, one other creature of man size or less can be taken through the door; this counts as two uses of the door. The door does not pass light, sound, or spell effects, nor can the caster see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing and similar magic will reveal the presence of a phase door but will not allow its use. The phase door lasts for one usage for every two levels of experience of the spellcaster. It can be dispelled only by a casting of dispel magic from a higher-level wizard, or from several lower-level wizards, casting in concert, whose combined levels of experience are more than double that of the wizard who cast the spell (this is the only instance in which dispel effects can be combined). Rumor has it that this spell has been adapted by a certain powerful wizard (or wizards) to create renewable (or permanent) portals, which may (or may not) be keyed to specific individuals (henchmen) or items (such as rings)."

In addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the caster gains 360° vision and can detect invisibility and detect phase at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are described below. Eye of the Mind. This orb protects the caster against mental attack, charm, or influence, including charm, beguiling, hold, and emotion effects. The first such attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to charm person like the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb. Eye of the Sword. This eye deflects the first physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as magic missiles for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium (1 hit) impact) Eye of the Mage. One manifestation of raw energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot long by 5-foot wide lightning bolt that inflicts 4d8 damage (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either use expends the eye’s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1-3 hits) electricity) Eye of Venom. This eye can be used to halt any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round. Eye of the Spirit. The first attack that affects the victim’s life energy, including energy drain, strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar, or death is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye’s power by casting enervation (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet. Eye of Artifice. This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a wand of lightning) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a dispel magic cast at 8th level. Eye of Stone. This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes. It can also be expended to cast hold person. Although any number of eyes can defend the wizard in the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system. The material component is seven blessed gemstones worth at least 50gp each."

Shadow engines are accompanied by illusory crews of the appropriate number and race. The engines can move at a rate of 20 yards per turn and are unaffected by terrain considerations. (The caster can choose to slow them when passing through rough terrain to aid the illusion of reality.) Shadow engines cannot carry real troops. They can be fired at the same rate as real engines of the appropriate type, but a hit causes only one-half the damage normal for that type of engine (round fractions down). A shadow engine remains in existence until the spell duration expires, until an enemy unit approaches within 10 yards, or until it suffers damage from an enemy missile attack. When any of these conditions occur, the engine vanishes. If a single spell has created multiple engines, only the engine struck vanishes; the others remain. The crew associated with a shadow engine must remain with that engine; it cannot move more than 5 yards away from the engine itself.

		"description": "According to one view of the universe, what we perceive as gravity is actually a localized warping of the fabric of space-time. The spacewarp spell creates a temporary but very intense warping in a limited area. When the priest casts this spell, he selects a specific point to be the center of effect. This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including in midair. When the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point. This localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not affect the ground itself-- soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to the effect. An object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would if it were falling toward the ground. When the object reaches the center, it instantly ceases its movement. If objects are already at the center, newly arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet) to the newly arriving objects. Objects previously at the center must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount of damage. Consider the following example. An orc is 10 feet away from the center of effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters collide forcefully. The bandit suffers 3d6 hit points of damage--the falling damage associated with a 30-foot fall. The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount. Other things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit's horse was 50 feet away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit. The center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage. When the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal. If the spell has lifted any characters or objects off the ground, they immediately fall back to the ground, suffering the appropriate amount of falling damage. The material components are a lodestone and a sphere of obsidian, both of which are consumed in the casting."

		"description": "This spell gives the wild mage the ability to seize magical energy directed at him and reshape it as he desires. While it is in effect, the spell gives no visible sign of its existence. It offers no protection against area effect spells. If a wild mage is the target of a spell or magical item, this spell automatically allows him a saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent's spell has normal effects. If the saving throw is successful, the spell shape absorbs the magical energy of the opponent's spell. The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates. For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a spell shape and is struck by a finger of death (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has feeblemind memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn't get a wild surge) and the feeblemind is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original feeblemind memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round. If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell. The material component is a diamond worth no less than 2,000 gp. When the spell is cast, the diamond is transformed into a lump of coal."

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but specifically excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, etc. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area within which the protected wizard is standing. From seven to ten spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows for certain how effective the spell is. A spell may be only partially turned--divide the number of remaining levels that can be turned by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect is turned, with the remainder affecting the caster. For example, an incoming fireball is centered on a wizard with one level of spell turning left. This means that 2/3 of the fireball affects the protected wizard, 1/3 affects the caster, and each is the center of a fireball effect. If the rolled damage is 40 points, the protected wizard receives 27 points of damage and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any creatures in the respective areas) can roll saving throws vs. spell for half damage. A partially turned hold or paralysis spell will act as a slow spell on those who are 50% or more affected. If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects: See book for table. The material component for the spell is a small silver mirror"

		"description": "This cooperative spell is rarely used or spoken of, since its requirements are strict and the outcome is uncertain. The spell must be cast by six priests of the same faith. All six must touch hands at the time of casting. At the completion of the spell, the priests fall into a trance. The life essences of the priests leave their bodies and merge at a point within 10 feet of the casters. The spirits of the priests meld together to form the avatar of the priests' deity. In this manner, the six characters become a single being with all the powers and abilities allowed to that avatar. The only stipulation is that the priests' deity cannot have created all avatars allowed to it at that moment. If this has happened, the spell fails and the priests are drained as described below. If the spell succeeds, the priests have completely given their wills over to their deity, essentially forming the vessel into which it funnels power. In becoming the avatar, the priests retain the ability to make most of their own decisions. (The six must work in harmony or allow one of their number to decide all actions.) However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires--the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity. Although the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time. If the priests are not released at the end of the spell's duration, they instantly die. A deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane. Such a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy. For dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain. If a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM. (Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.) While the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance. The priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them). Any damage to a priest's body requires an instant system shock roll. If successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die). If the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends. Characters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated. They have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered. If the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends. Even if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained. All spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again. The physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast. Since damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him). Each priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god). The material component is an offering appropriate to the deity. The DM determines the exact nature of this offering."

The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires one full round after the spell is cast. During the transformation, there's an 18% chance that the targeted creature suffers a system shock failure and dies. The creature must roll percentile dice and add its Constitution score to the roll. If the total is 18 or less, the creature dies. If the total is 19 or more, the creature survives the transformation; the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue, although faint magic is detected from the stone if someone checks for it. Note that a creature with a Constitution of 18 or more will always survive the transformation. Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body--i.e., chipping is equal to a slight wound, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is serious damage. The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to his normal state instantly, act, and then return to the statue state, if he so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.

Both objects must be touched by the wizard during casting. The two items must be of the same category (blunt weapon, edged weapon, ring, amulet, shield, armor, wand, etc.). The enchantment can be transferred only to a nonmagical item. Only the energy of one item can be transferred; it is not possible to combine two magical items into one item. The new item has all the properties of the original magical item (including the same number of charges, if any). At the culmination of the spell, the original magical object is allowed an item saving throw vs. disintegration with all modifiers it is allowed as a magical item. Exceptionally powerful objects (such as artifacts) may be considered to automatically succeed the saving throw at the DM's discretion. If the saving throw is successful, the magical objects resists effect and the spell ends in failure. If the roll is failed, the magical item loses all of its powers, which are transferred to the previously nonmagical object. Even if the magical item fails its saving throw, the spell's success is not guaranteed. There is a chance that the enchantment might be lost. The base chance of this occurring is 100%, modified by -5% per level of the caster. Thus, a 20th-level wizard has no chance of losing the magic. If the enchantment is lost, both items become nonmagical. The material component is the nonmagical item which is to receive the enchantment. It must be of equal or greater value than the object to be drained. "

Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected. The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted. The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell."

(DMs may rule that the most powerful of magics, such as wishes, and creatures of demigod or higher status can affect the subject.) When the priest casts the spell, he or she states the duration for which the spell will remain in effect (the maximum is one full day per level of the caster). Once the spell is cast, this duration cannot be changed; the priest cannot terminate the spell before the stated time has elapsed.

Timelessness is also an effective form of long-term imprisonment, as long as the priest is around to cast the spell again at the appropriate time. This is an exceptionally powerful spell.

The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most circumstances the tsunami can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster, so a 15th-level priest would summon a tsunami 30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can appear anywhere within the spell's range and immediately sweeps forward in the direction specified by the caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at the casting priest. The tsunami moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one round at 14th level, two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level. Ships caught by the tsunami must make a seaworthiness check (see Table 77: Tsunami Ship Types in the DMG) with a penalty equal to the wave's height in feet. For example, a tsunami created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a -30% penalty to a vessel's seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10 rounds, with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers caught in the wave must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the wave; any creature in the water in the wave's path will be carried along as long as it lasts. If the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the tsunami loses 5 feet of height for every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could wash 120 yards inland before there was nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet of height the tsunami currently possesses and are carried along until it ends. Air-breathing creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright by this treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave's current height of being destroyed by the tsunami (90% for a 30-foot wave, for example) while stone buildings have a chance equal to the wave's height (or 30% for a 30-foot wave). Topography may influence or channel the wave's advance, so a good-sized hill could stop a tsunami cold, although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and vegetation by the wave. Note that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an awesome amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path. The tsunami is so strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6 hours after summoning it."

If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, etc. The priest can regain his physical form as desired, each change to and from vaporous form requiring five rounds. While in vaporous form, the priest and companions are hit only by magic or magical weaponry, though they may be subject to high winds at the DM's discretion. No spellcasting is possible in vaporous form. The material components of this spell are fire and holy water."

The wizard must decide which effect is desired with regard to what creature type or alignment before beginning the spellcasting, for the components of each application differ. The spell cannot be cast upon living creatures. Antipathy: This spell causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to not touch the affected item. If a saving throw vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay in the area or touch the item, but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1 point of Dexterity per round (for the spell's duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. Failure to save vs. spell forces the being to abandon the area or item, shunning it permanently and never willingly returning to it until the spell is removed or expires. The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar. Sympathy: By casting the sympathy application of the spell, the wizard can cause a particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to be in an area or touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent saving throw must be made 1d6 turns later. If this saving throw fails, the affected creature will return to the area or object. The material components of this spell are 1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop of honey. Note that the particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically--for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named--for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, etc. If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube can be enchanted for each experience level of the caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures or characters save vs. spell with a -2 penalty. "

		"description": "  A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from another plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram; other creatures can be physically confined. The duration of the spell depends upon the form of the binding and the level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time the spell is actually uttered. The components vary according to the form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured. Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th through 8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are: Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier. Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per level of the caster(s). Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per level of the caster(s). Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means until freed. The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken. Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic.  The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases. A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is broken and the creature is free."

If one cannot destroy the other, one will go insane and destroy itself (90% likely to be the clone), or possibly both will become mad and destroy themselves (2% chance). These events nearly always occur within one week of the dual existence. Note that the clone is the person as he existed at the time at which the flesh was taken for the spell component, and all subsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a physical duplicate, and possessions of the original are another matter entirely. A clone takes 2d4 months to grow, and only after that time is dual existence established. Furthermore, the clone has one less Constitution point than the body it was cloned from; the cloning fails if the clone would have a Constitution of 0. The material component of the spell is a small piece of the flesh from the person to be duplicated. The DM may, in addition, add other stipulations to the success of a cloning effort,requiring that some trace of life must remain in the flesh sample, that some means of storing and preserving the sample must be devised and maintained, etc."

Of course, if the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand comes, the message is understood but no saving throw is necessary and the suggestion is ineffective. The caster must be familiar with the creature contacted and must know its name and appearance well. If the creature in question is not in the same plane of existence as the spellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that the demand does not arrive. Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably at the option of the DM. The demand, if received, will be understood even if the creature has an Intelligence ability score as low as 1 (animal Intelligence). Creatures of demigod status or higher can choose to come or not, as they please. The demand message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the suggestion.

		"description": "  This powerful spell allows a caster to transfer a large area of land in the Prime Material plane to any of the elemental planes. All buildings, people, and wildlife within the area of effect are also transported. The land forms a pocket of the Prime Material plane within the elemental plane. The pocket is a sphere with a diameter equal to the diameter of the land. The surface of the pocket allows creatures to enter or exit the pocket, but prevents the elements from entering the pocket. Inside the pocket, the land is surrounded by air of a temperature matching that of the Prime Material plane at the moment the land was moved. In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket. Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane.Thus,if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental plane of Fire,he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the elemental plane of Fire; such as hardened magma or magically crystallized fire.The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under surface(at a depth of no more than three fee). The wizard must be within the area to be moved when he casts the spell. When the land moves, a hemispherical crater is left behind in the Prime Material plane. Inside its pocket on the desired plane, the land continues its existence as if nothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures. Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell. The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose. If the device is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails, allowing the energies of the elemental plane to flood into the protected area."

The wizard casts the desired spell and then follows it with the permanency spell. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a wizard of greater level than the spellcaster was when he cast the spell. Each casting of Greater Permanency reduces the wizard's constitution by 1 point.  The personal spells upon which a permanency is known to be effective are as follows: comprehend languages, detect evil, detect invisibility, detect magic, infravision, protection from cantrips, protection from evil, protection from normal missiles, read magic, tongues, unseen servant. These spells may not be made permanent upon other creatures. In addition to personal use, the permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent: enlarge, fear, gust of wind, invisibility, magic mouth, prismatic sphere, stinking cloud, wall of fire, wall of force, web. Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and be rendered permanent: alarm, audible glamer, dancing lights, solid fog, wall of fire, distance distortion, teleport. These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated. At the DM's option, permanency might become unstable or fail after a long period of at least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogether. The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that the wizard never learns what is possible except by the success or failure of his research."

In game terms,the character suffers only 1 point of damage from any type S or type P attack,plus any magical adjustment for the weapon.For example,if struck by a long sword +1,he would suffer only 2 points of damage.Strength and specialization bonuses are ignored.If the wizard is dismembered,he suffers no additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs removed,and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place for one full turn.The heart of stone is also partially effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising,swelling,and crushed blood vessels.Against bludgeoning weapons,the wizard only suffers half the normal damage.Cause wound spell always inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell.While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage,any damage sustained interrupts spellcasting.   In addition to resisting injury,the heart of stone also renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion,whether normal or magical.He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs,petrification attacks.  While the heart of stone is quite powerful,it has limitations.First of all,determined physical attack can eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to injury-a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can finish him off 1 point at a time if that's what it takes. Second,the heart confers no protection against other attack forms,such as fire,electricity,cold,acid,and so on,although any bleeding caused by a burn is ignored.Disintegration effects also affect the caster.Most importantly,the caster loses the ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost hit points with the passage of time.Healing spells,potions and items are reduced to their minimum effect,so a cure serious wounds (2d8+1 hit points restored)would only return 3 hit points to a wizard protected by heart of stone.However,limited wish or wish can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster or all but 1d4 hit points,respectively. In addition to these disadvantages,heart of stone also renders the caster vulnerable in one other way;his own real heart can be destroyed,instantly slaying him.Naturally,the caster will want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this happening.The living heart continues to beat for the duration of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to protect it-the caster could leave it lying on the floor,if he wished.    The heart of stone cannot be dispelled,although a more powerful negation magic such as Mordenkainen's disjunction can bring the spell to an end.Stone to flesh also undoes the magic of the heart of stone.No matter how the spell is ended,the wizard's own living heart instantly returns to its proper place,and the stone heart appears wherever the living heart was kept.At this time,any injuries the wizard currently has are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again.For example,a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead suffers 6d6 when the spell ends.     The material component for this spell is the stone heart itself.This must be a carved stone of quality (jade,obsidian,or gold-veined marble would be appropriate)worth not less than 5,000 gold pieces.It must be prepared by use of the enchant an item spell.The stone is not consumed at the spell's end and may be used again if it is undamaged.

		"description": "  This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, which grants him several powerful resistances and abilities.While the spell is in effect, the caster can only be injured by blunt weapons of +3 or better value, or monsters of 8+3 Hit dice or more. Slashing weapons,falling, crushing, and constriction attacks of all type are completely unable to harm the caster,although an attack may knock him off-balance or pin him beneath tons of debris. Spells or attacks that affect the subject's physiology or respiration-for example, poison, cloud kill, enfeeblement, contagion or vain touch-fail completely, since the caster has no physiology or respiration while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3000 pounds. The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire attacks. If he saves, he takes quarter damage;if not, he takes half damage. If hit with a rod of smiting, he takes 2d8+6 points of damage unless the attacker rolls a natural 20.If this occurs, then the damage is doubled. In addition to the natural immunities of an iron body, the wizard enjoys powerful offensive abilities. His strength score is raised to 20 for the duration of the spell, and he can punch or bludgeon his enemies twice per round for 1d4 points of damage per blow, plus his strength bonus. Unfortunately,his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a -2 penalty to his initiative rolls.Most importantly, the wizard's clumsiness and lack of breath prevent him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect. Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example,rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell.Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster, And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water-although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean-at least until the spell expired.Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well. The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem. "

Range of control extends to a maximum distance of 10 yards per level after the sphere has actually succeeded in encapsulating a subject or subjects. Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the perceived weight is only 1/16 of the actual weight, so the orb can be rolled without exceptional effort. Because of the reduced weight, rapid motion or falling within the field of the sphere is relatively harmless to the object therein, although it can be disastrous should the globe disappear when the subject inside is high above a hard surface. The caster can dismiss the effect with a word.In addition to a hemispherical piece of diamond and a matching piece of gum arabic,the caster must also have a pair of small bar magnets as material components for this spell."

		"description": "  This spell changes one object or creature into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:See book for table. A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns. All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations. The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items. The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke."

		"description": "  This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When the spell is cast, the wizard dictates what will and will not be observed in the area of effect. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, the caster could specify the illusion of him and another playing chess for the duration of the spell, but he could not have the illusionary chess players take a break, make dinner,and then resume their game. He could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. He could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that his troops be undetected, or even that every fifth man or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by the caster with no saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of men standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another! Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a saving throw, assuming the hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion."

		"description": "  By means of this spell, a wizard can force a creature or object into the very earth or floor upon which it stands. When casting the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for the remainder of the round without interruption. At that juncture, the subject creature or object becomes rooted to the spot unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a creature) or disintegration (for an object with magical properties) is successful. (Note: 'magical properties' include those of magical items as listed in the Dungeon Master Guide, those of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items with protection type spells or with permanent magical properties or similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not entitled to a saving throw. If a subject fails its saving throw, it becomes of slightly greater density than the surface upon which it stands. The spellcaster now has the option of ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it is, in which case the spell expires in four turns, and the subject returns to normal. If the caster proceeds with the spell (into the next round), the subject begins to sink slowly into the ground. Before any actions are taken in the new round, the subject sinks one-quarter of its height; after the first group acts, another quarter; after the second group acts, another; and at the end of the round, the victim is totally sunken into the ground. This entombment places a creature or object in a state of suspended animation. The cessation of time means that the subject does not grow older. Bodily and other functions virtually cease, but the subject is otherwise unharmed. The subject exists in undamaged form in the surface into which it was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the surface as the subject has height--a 6-foot-tall victim will be 6 feet beneath the surface, while a 60- foot-tall subject will have its uppermost point 60 feet below ground level. If the ground around the subject is somehow removed, the spell is broken and the subject returns to normal, but it does not rise up. Spells such as dig, transmute rock to mud, and freedom (the reverse of the 9th-level spell imprisonment) will not harm the sunken creature or object and will often be helpful in recovering it. If a detect magic spell is cast over an area upon which a sink spell was used, it reveals a faint magical aura of undefinable nature, even if the subject is beyond detection range. If the subject is within range of the detection, the spell's schools can be discovered (alteration and enchantment)."

		"description": "  This spell forces the creature's life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered. The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters. The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.  The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.  Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force."

Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows). As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane.  At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.  Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a dispel magic spell or the destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime Material Plane).  The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.) Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life stealing in the Negative Energy plane)."

		"description": "  This powerful spell is similar to the 6th-level contingency spell. Chain contingency allows the caster to designate either two or three spells that will take effect automatically under a specific set of conditions.In other words, when a set of conditions is met, the designated spells are cast immediately without the caster's intervention. Chain contingency must be cast together with the spells it is to trigger.The caster may choose either two spells to occur simultaneously or three spells to occur consecutively, one per round.Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6th level contingency spell may not be included.The casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of the spells to be triggered. Unlike the contingency spell,spells 'stored' in chain contingency can affect creatures other than the caster.These instructions must be carefully worded;the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's intentions.  In casting chain contingency, the wizard defines the conditions that will trigger the stored spells. This definition must be carefully worded but may be as limiting or general as the caster desires.The caster also states the exact order, target, range, and manner in which the stored spells are to be cast. The spell has several limitations in triggering its spells.It does not have any powers of discernment;thus,an instruction to target the highest level enemy is not possible.Furthermore, the conditions cannot involve a delay;a spell cannot be ordered to trigger three turns after 1 sneeze.When the named conditions are met,the chain contingency is automatically triggered. If all specifics of casting a spell are not specified.(e.g., target or area of effect),the effect is automatically centered on the caster.Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the caster's height,the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word. The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1000 gp value;a spell using creature and an ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell)which must be carried by the spellcaster in order for the chain contingency to perform its function when triggered."

		"description": "  The magic of this spell causes metal, whether as soft as gold or as hard as adamantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as brittle and fragile as crystal. Thus, a sword, metal shield, metal armor, or even an iron golem can be changed to a delicate, glasslike material easily shattered by any forceful blow. Furthermore, this change is unalterable by any means short of a wish spell; a dispel magic will not reverse the spell. The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected, and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts and relics constructed of metal may be affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely. Affected items not immediately protected are shattered and permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or any weighty weapon, including a staff."

A monster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both for hit points and attack ability. A character loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently (until regained through adventuring, if applicable). The material component of this spell is essence of spectre or vampire dust.

The spell remains effective for only a single round. Humans or humanoids brought below zero energy levels by this spell can be animated as juju zombies under the control of the caster. The caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) chance to be affected by the dust, losing one point of Constitution at the same time as the victim is drained.

		"description": "  This spell grants the caster a powerful sixth sense in relation to himself or another.Although cast upon himself, the wizard can specify that he or another is the beneficiary of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the object of the spell. Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the wizard would be warned in advance if a thief were about to attempt to backstab him, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting him with a spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him personally, the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the wizard a general idea of what action he might take to best protect himself--duck, jump right, close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.  When another person is the object of the spell, the wizard receives warnings about that person. He must still communicate this to the other person to negate any surprise. Shouting a warning, yanking the person back, and even telepathically communicating through a crystal ball can all be accomplished before the trap is sprung, if the wizard does not hesitate. However, the object of the spell does not gain the defensive bonus to his Armor Class. The material component for this spell is a hummingbird's feather."

First, it causes an interdimensional connection between the plane of existence the wizard is on and the plane on which dwells a specific being of great power; thus, the being is able to merely step through the gate or portal from its plane to that of the caster. Second, the utterance of the spell attracts the attention of the sought-after dweller on the other plane. When casting the spell, the wizard must name the entity he desires to use the gate and come to the wizard's aid. There is a 100% certainty that something steps through the gate. Unless the DM has some facts prepared regarding the minions serving the being called forth by the gate spell, the being itself comes. If the matter is trifling, the being might leave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the wizard, or attack the wizard. If the matter is of middling importance, the being can take some positive action to set matters right, then demand appropriate repayment. If the matter is urgent, the being can act accordingly and ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if appropriate. The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors, including the alignments of the wizard and the deity, the nature of his companions, and who or what opposes or threatens the wizard. Such beings generally avoid direct conflict with their equals or betters. The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely) or remain to take action. Casting this spell ages the wizard five years."

		"description": "  When an imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the 9th-level wizard spell temporal stasis) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell, with the creature's name and background, is cast. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or similar means will not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned. The imprisonment spell functions only if the subject creature's name and background are known. The reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the spot at which a creature was entombed and sunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at that spot. If the caster does not perfectly intone the name and background of the creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance that 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from imprisonment at the same time. Note: The exact details of any creatures freed are up to the DM. A random method of determining this is to roll percentile dice twice (once for imprisoned creature density and once for a base number of creatures at maximum density). The rolls are multiplied and rounded to the nearest whole number. Each released creature has a 10% chance to be in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9, and the exact monsters determined by the random encounter tables. For example, if the initial rolls were 22 and 60, the number of monsters released is .22 x .60 = .1320 = 13 monsters. Since only 10% of these will be in the immediate vicinity of the caster, the wizard may encounter only one or two of them."

		"description": "By means of this spell the caster can hear their true name being spoken by any creature in range. The caster can picture the speaker in their mind and know their location. If the caster wishes, they may observe the speaker as if clairvoyance, clairaudience, and comprehend languages were cast, up to 1 hour. As long as the casters name continues to be brought up in the conversation, the 1 hour duration refreshes. Should another person within range speak the caster's name, the caster can picture that speaker in their mind, know their location, and choose to scry upon them. In doing so, any other scrying attempts end and cannot be restarted unless the caster's name is spoken again. To cast this spell, the diviner must find a comfortable position, usually seated on a cushion but not necessarily, center her mind, and clear her thoughts, in a process that takes 1 turn. Hereafter she begins to hear her name spoken by those in range, and get glimpses of those speaking her name. If the caster is the subject of much gossip in a large city, she may be bombarded by faces, locations, and her name. At any point, the caster may mute her attunement to those speaking her name. This is useful when scrying upon a subject and wishing to be uninterrupted, or when carrying a conversation without wanting to break the concentration on the spell. The range of the spell is limited to the current plane of existence, and grows from nothing at a rate of 60mph (1 mile a minute), centered on the caster. As long as the caster maintains concentration, the area of effect will continue to grow. If the caster wishes to limit the area they are listening to, they may listen to specific bands no smaller than 1 mile in width.  Example: Quinti sits atop her tower in the center of the city which she rules and casts Listen. After a turn of casting, she begins to hear the people in her city that are speaking about her. The city is large, and she is its ruler, so her name is said every few minutes. Quinti looks in on a conversation at a tavern where tales of her exploits are told, she spies the wife of one of her guardsmen arguing about how much time he spends at work and lamenting his close relationship with Quinti, and she views a woman in the dungeons praying to Velthara (goddess of Vengeance) to rend Quinti head to toe. After an hour of this, the range of the spell has extended to cover nearby towns, so she changes the area of effect to a band 1 mile wide, centered 25 miles out. Now Quinti can hear her name being spoken by anyone between 24.5 and 25.5 miles from her. Quniti does this because there is a town 25 miles to the east that rebels have been recruiting from and she is hoping to catch them in conversation, but instead hears her name said by a dying dwarf, in dwarven, 25 miles under the city. The caster must remain motionless to continue concentration, which requires Constitution checks every so often, with cumulative -1 penalties after the first. A caster who is seated comfortably makes checks every 8 hours, seated normally makes checks every 4 hours, and standing make checks every hour. Environmental effects may shift these times. Seated comfortably in freezing temperatures might require checks every 2 hours. Outside events may force additional checks.  For example, Quinti is traveling on the road and stops at an inn for the night. She has a messenger who is supposed to call out to her and relay a message an hour after sundown, so she retreats to her room at sundown and casts Listen. 10 minutes into the spell, the innkeeper comes into her room to change the sheets, see's what's going on, and leaves the sheets on the foot of the bed Quinti is casting from, and exits the room. The DM rules this is enough of a disturbing event that it might break her concentration, so she calls for a con check, which Quinti passes. She continues to wait for her messenger who doesn't speak up in the first 8 hours. Concerned, she decides to continue channeling and listening to the range she expects, but now must make a con check. Since she has already made 1 check, she must now make this second one at -1. When the innkeeper comes in to bring her breakfast at sun up, she is forced to make a check at -2, which she fails. Quinti's 9th level spell was interrupted by a too-eager innkeeper who must now face her wrath."

Any creature in the straight-line path of these missiles receives the full effect, without benefit of a saving throw. The meteor missiles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each bursts as a fireball. The large spheres (2-foot diameter) inflict 10d4 points of damage, bursting in a diamond or box pattern. Each has a 30-foot diameter area of effect, and each sphere is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of effect and exposing the center to all four blasts.

They burst in a pattern of a box within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides 20 feet long. Note that the center has four areas of overlapping effect, and there are numerous peripheral areas that have two overlapping areas of effect.

Thus, all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and relics, arms and armor, swords, and miscellaneous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcaster can possibly lose all their magical properties when the Mordenkainen's disjunction spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% chance per level of destroying an antimagic shell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest or connection with the device. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the casting wizard must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities."

The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred. For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with. A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification. The material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell's duration.

The sphere is a black ball of nothingness about 2 feet in diameter that instantly and utterly destroys any matter that comes into contact with it. The sphere appears anywhere in the spell's range and moves up to 15 feet per round as the wizard directs.If the wizard attempts to bring the sphere into contact with a living creature, the potential victim gains a saving throw vs. breath weapon to dodge aside, but a victim who is unaware of the sphere's appearance or unable to move is destroyed without a saving throw. Once conjured, the sphere of ultimate destruction may not move exactly as the caster wishes.The wizard has a 75% chance to control it,plus 1% per point of intelligence over 12 and 3% for each point over 15. In other words, a wizard with an intelligence of 18 would gain a +12%bonus to his chance to control the sphere.If the wizard fails to control the sphere in any given round, it automatically moves directly towards him at its maximum speed of 15 feet per round.Unlike the magical item, another wizard may not contest the caster's control of a sphere of ultimate destruction unless the second wizard possesses a talisman of the sphere. Should a gate spell be cast upon the sphere, there is a 50% chance that the sphere is destroyed, a 35% chance that nothing happens, and a 15%chance that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything in a 180-foot radius to another plane of existence. If the sphere is touched by a rod of cancellation, a tremendous explosion inflicts 3d4*10 point of damage to every thing within 60 feet as the two forces negate each other. No other spell or magical item has any effect on a sphere of ultimate destruction. There is a 5%chance that any particular manifestation of this spell does not cause a victim's utter destruction but instead transports him to a random plane of existence. The conjuring wizard has no way of knowing whether he has destroyed his enemy or merely blasted him into some remote dimension. The material component of this spell is a dark crystal ball that has been on the ethereal plane and that can be comfortably held in two hands. "

Its body functions virtually cease. This state persists until the magic is removed by a dispel magic spell or the reverse of the spell (temporal reinstatement) is uttered. Note that the reverse requires only a single word and no somatic or material components.The material component of a temporal stasis spell is a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust, with each crushed stone worth at least 100 gp."

Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for 1d3 rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures, except for those of demigod and greater status or unique creatures, are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. (The spell duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the area, the spell is immediately negated. When the spell duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time. Note: It is recommended that the DM use a stopwatch or silently count to time this spell. If the caster is unable to complete the intended action before the spell duration expires, he will probably be caught in an embarrassing situation. The use of a teleport spell before the expiration of the time stop spell is permissible."

		"description": " This spell confronts those affected by it with phantasmal images of their most feared enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually occurs in the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them.The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's phantasmal nemesis from the weird spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable.Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a round. During the course of the spell, the caster must concentrate fully upon maintaining it. If the combat goes beyond 10 rounds, those who saved against the spell can take action. If the caster is disturbed, the weird spell ends immediately. Creatures attacked while paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis immediately."

		"description": " By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to channel raw magical energy through himself,shaping it into any form or effect he desires. The energy is similar in many ways to a wish spell,but has unique differences. Wildfire allows the caster to create the effect of any wizard spell of 8th level or lower. He need only have general knowledge of the spell and its effects; the spell does not need to be in his own spellbooks. Any normal saving throws vs. the spell effects are made at a -2 penalty. Wildfire can also be used in the creation of magical items. The energy created by the spell may be used to generate effects that are not created by known spells.Wildfire can also be used to create items out of nothing. The magical energy can be shaped and hardened to form solid objects. These objects have a greenish, glowing tinge and radiate magic.These objects are stronger than steel yet possess almost no weight. They are immune to fire, cold, electricity, and all forms of magical attack except dispel magic and wish spells. Even if they are subjected to these spells, a saving throw is allowed (equal to the creator"

		"description": " This spell is similar in effect to wildstrike and wildzone. When cast, a wall of faint, multicolored lights springs into existence at the point indicated by the caster. These lights form a line 150 feet long. After the first round of the spell, the wizard can move the wall of lights. Each round, the caster can move the wall in the same direction or as much as 45 degrees to either side.Once the wall is set in motion, it cannot be stopped unless the spell is cancelled or dispelled.The lights can move 60 feet per round. The wildwind has two significant effects. First,all creatures struck by the magical lights suffer 2d6 points of damage. Second, any spellcaster struck while attempting to cast a spell automatically triggers a wild surge (use Table 2). Magical items that expend charges that touch the wall of lights automatically release one charge, also resulting in a wild surge."

		"description": " The wish spell is a more potent version of a limited wish. If it is used to alter reality with respect to damage sustained by a party, to bring a dead creature to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spellcaster (and his party) from one place to another, it will not cause the wizard any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried out. Casting a wish spell ages the caster five years.Discretionary power of the DM is necessary in order to maintain game balance. For example, wishing another creature dead is grossly unfair; the DM might well advance the spellcaster to a future period in which the creature is no longer alive, effectively putting the wishing character out of the campaign."
